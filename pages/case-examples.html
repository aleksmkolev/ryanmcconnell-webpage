                    <p>This section of the website is a list of case examples that highlight a condition that was either
                        managed or resolved whilst the client and myself were working together.</p>

                    <p>The purpose of this section is to show examples of what kind of issues I might work with, as well
                        as what my treatment plan is approximately for said issue. In this manner any prospective client
                        can see what my therapeutic approach entails and can then decide whether they believe a similar
                        approach would be appropriate for themselves. There are several other mental health issues I
                        treat which do not yet have a case example related to them. Please feel free to email to see if
                        I work with the condition you would like to address.</p>

                    <p>Currently I have the following case examples presented:</p>

                    <p><strong>CASE ONE: Phobia</strong> – Client CR approached me regarding a phobia of cats. This case
                        demonstrates how I approach working with phobia. It also features a detailed explanation of the
                        BWRT level one process.</p>

                    <p><strong>CASE TWO: General Anxiety</strong> – Client TN dealing with heightened anxiety. She has a
                        narcissistic mother and alcoholic husband resulting in a complex relationship with both of them.
                        In addition she is dealing with a narcissistic and childish boss. The case demonstrates a
                        variety of methods used to manage said issues.</p>

                    <p><strong>CASE THREE: PTSD Related to Childhood & Self-Esteem</strong> – Continuation from case
                        two, we tackle client TN's PTSD relating to childhood trauma via memory adaption and level two
                        BWRT which focuses on self-image.</p>

                    <p><strong>CASE FOUR: Alcoholism and Sexual Assault</strong> – The husband of TN. Excessive drinking
                        each day, he is dealing with the trauma caused by being sexually assaulted when younger. Here I
                        demonstrate how BWRT can be used on the memory of the sexual assault. We then work on
                        development of a healthy routine and boundaries as well as BWRT related to alcoholism. In
                        addition I use several CBT tools.</p>

                    <p><strong>CASE FIVE: Persistent Depressive Disorder & Motivational Issues</strong> – Client MV
                        shows signs of depression, fatigue, hopelessness and a lack of motivation. A combination of CBT,
                        introspective writing, goal orientation tools are used as well as BWRT for development of
                        motivation is used.</p>

                    <p><strong>CASE SIX: PTSD Related to Military Service</strong> – Client YR has nightmares and anger
                        issues relating to accidentally killing civilians during war. Here we use CBT, BWRT and socratic
                        reasoning to manage the guilt and PTSD symptoms.</p>

                    <p><strong>CASE SEVEN: Pornography Addiction</strong> – Client GK has issues around controlling
                        pornography use, fidelity and management of a shame fetishism. This case involves going through
                        his past and coming to an understanding why these fetishisms have occurred and managing them
                        appropriately.</p>

                    <p><strong>CASE EIGHT: Marital Counselling</strong> – Continuation of case seven where I work with
                        client BK and her husband GK on their relationship issues. Involves elements of the Gottman
                        technique and CBT use.</p>

                    <p><strong>Please note:</strong> All names have been changed and some other details have been
                        minorly altered in keeping within the therapeutic alliance and a sensible code of ethics.
                        However the basic facts and treatment plan are kept as truthful as possible.</p>

                    <p>In addition in some cases there were several more sessions with the client, but for the sake of
                        brevity I haven't outlined every session's work.</p>

                        <div class="case-session active" id="case1-overview">
                            <p>This case example is an example of how I treat phobia. Whilst the process is largely the
                                same for each phobia as outlined below, the methodology may vary depending on the nature
                                of the phobia.</p>

                            <p>This case with client CR is focused on the identification and management of Phobia. It
                                involves predominantly using BWRT (Brain Wave Recursive therapy) which is a therapy that
                                focuses on subconscious alteration. This is appropriate for the case because phobic
                                response is deeply connected to our subconscious templates/ negative memories.</p>

                            <p>CR husband approached me regarding a phobia of cats. CR is a 42 year old woman who was
                                suffering from a crippling phobia related to cats for the past 30 years.</p>

                            <p>CR explained to me that this was caused by an incident she had with cats. As a young girl
                                of around five, CR was to take the rubbish down from her parents apartment to a garbage
                                disposal in the basement. This basement had a long corridor at the end of which was a
                                series of bins. She needed to take the rubbish across the corridor and into the bins at
                                the end of said corridor. In the rafters of this corridor were a great deal of cats,
                                more than a dozen. CR would have to walk underneath these cats, which she stated she
                                could not see due to the darkness except for their eyes which frightened her . She was
                                repeatedly forced to do this by her parents, despite strongly protesting repeatedly,
                                resulting in continuous negative exposure to the cats. The cats being on higher ground
                                and looking down upon her, as well as only being able to see their eyes, created a fear
                                of cats based on the unknown and the idea they could jump down upon her. As a result she
                                developed a strong sense of distrust and fear of cats, leading to an irrational phobia.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="case-session" id="case1-session1">
                            <p>I treat phobias using a modified protocol developed by the BWRT counsel. To briefly
                                outline how the basics work the protocol looks to change the worst memory a client has
                                about an issue and alter the mental association with that image.</p>

                            To put this in context, when an event of trauma occurs in your life (e.g. loss, sexual
                            assault, verbal abuse, physical assault etc) that leaves a significant emotional impact
                            (fear, pain, anxiety, anger, embarrassment) that memory is saved to the subconscious mind,
                            alongside the attached emotion. Whenever you are forced to confront an issue of a similar
                            nature the emotions associated with this traumatic memory will come to the forefront of your
                            mind and will create a similar sensation to what you felt at the time of the trauma. The
                            subconscious mind does this to protect you and as an effort to steer you away from the thing
                            you have a phobic response to.

                            <p>Sometimes there are cases where the individual does not have a clear negative memory
                                associated with the phobia, we use the most negative mental construct they have in their
                                mind.</p>

                            <p>A good example of this is myself. I used to have a terrible phobia of needles created
                                when I was younger. With the only apparent available date being my seventh birthday, my
                                mum took me to have the BCG vaccination. I vividly remember the nurse handing me a jammy
                                dodger biscuit and then her injecting the needle into my arm without me being aware. I
                                had a huge freak out episode during the vaccination and ran out of the hospital with the
                                needle still in my arm. After some coercing (I had climbed up a tree), they restrained
                                me, brought me back inside where it was necessary to have the injection a second time.
                            </p>

                            <p>As you might imagine that left me with a horrible phobia of injections for a large period
                                of my life. Every time I would be forced to have a vaccination I would be petrified,
                                resulting in a terrible wave of anxiety and severe panic attacks. As a result, I
                                actively avoided any situation where I would need to have an injection, missing out on a
                                lot of travel and job opportunities as a result. I no longer have this issue after
                                working with a BWRT practitioner. My result from that session is in fact what inspired
                                me to become a BWRT practitioner. </p>

                            <p>The way BWRT works with regards to phobia is to take the most powerful negative memory
                                you have of the associated issue. So in my case this memory of having the BCG as a
                                child. We then have the individual bring this memory to the forefront of the mind. We
                                then repeatedly overlay a positive memory that you have over and over again through a
                                semi-hypnosis process (you are awake for the whole experience, just imaging flashing
                                imagery as I verbally guide you). This process is spoken very quickly as the aim is to
                                communicate directly with the subconscious mind. After the BWRT session is completed,
                                the client is asked to recall the worked upon memory, whereby the emotions associated
                                with the memory should be completely changed. </p>

                            <p>After an hour of this work I no longer had any phobia of needles, and whilst I don’t
                                particularly like them, I am fine to have one at any time for any reason, which is
                                worlds apart from my previous ability to deal with injections. As you might imagine BWRT
                                is extremely effective at resolving trauma. Where it may take months of work utilizing
                                CBT techniques, phobia resolution with BWRT takes just a couple of hours.</p>

                            <p>I first had CR to bring this negative memory of taking the garbage past the cats. I had
                                her bring the most negative memory she had to the forefront of her mind and then to
                                focus on the worst part of the memory and bring the associated emotions to the forefront
                                of the mind. I then asked her to rate the memory in terms of fear where 0 is no anxiety
                                at all and 10 is high anxiety, she gave it a clear 10. This score is known as the PAL or
                                perceived arousal level. I asked her to then save that memory and titled it the frozen
                                memory (the reasoning for this name will become apparent as time goes on). </p>

                            <p>We then created what is known as the preferred response. This a memory or a mental
                                construct where the client feels roughly the opposite of how the negative frozen memory
                                makes them feel. In this instant the frozen memory was a memory with associated fear,
                                anxiety and discomfort. We are now looking for a memory where the client feels
                                comfortable, happy and relaxed. This can be a memory of anything, all that matters is
                                there is strong positive association with that recall. In this case, CR chose to use a
                                memory of a few days after the birth of her first born, holding her baby and feeling at
                                ease. This is a very positive memory for CR so it was a good choice. </p>

                            <p>The final construct created is called the future memory. This is the memory of a simple
                                everyday action. It could be making breakfast, going for a drive, a run etc. In this
                                case we choose making a packed lunch for her kids, which CR did most days. Whilst
                                picturing this future memory I have the client associate feelings of overcoming and tie
                                it with something mantric. In this case lines like ‘I am not afraid of cats’, ‘I have
                                really changed and grown’ and ‘I don’t care about cats anymore’. Such lines embedded
                                into the memory now continue to reinforce the work in the future after the therapy has
                                been completed. </p>

                            <p>At this point we ran through the BWRT process. In this case when using BWRT with phobia,
                                the experience takes around 10-15 minutes after which I put the client into a relaxed
                                state for another 5 minutes before testing to see what the associated PAL is now with
                                regards to the frozen memory. The initial memory had a 10/10 strength emotional
                                response. The BWRT process involves having the client picture moving between these
                                images among over elements, creating an overlapping effect within the mind. This
                                associated link allows for a change in perceived emotions towards a memory and even
                                towards a mental construct. In this case, cats. This is done through a scripted process,
                                during which the client is awake through the whole experience. </p>

                            <p>After we completed the BWRT process, I had the client bring to mind the negative frozen
                                memory and test the PAL again. CR said she had no anxiety whatsoever towards the memory
                                after completion and scored it a 0-1/10 for PAL. I consider this to be a positive
                                result. If the client still scores a 4 or higher, it usually means there is some other
                                unresolved element or the trauma is complex in nature. </p>

                            <p>Working with phobias is very quick when using BWRT. This particular instant took just a
                                single session of an hour and a half. In most cases we can resolve the phobie in a
                                single session. However there may be lingering effects on the personality (such as
                                general anxiety, depression or self-esteem issues) that we then may transition into
                                working on. Some examples of this is Case Three: PTSD related to childhood & self esteem
                                (Client TN) & Case Six: PTSD related to military service. I choose this case as it was
                                aa standalone session focused only on phobia. </p>

                            <p>What was particularly interesting about this case was shortly after we had finished (it
                                was a house call), I left their house and spotted a cat outside their home. I called the
                                client to come out and to test the work we had just done. We stood around 30 meters from
                                the cat initially and I asked her how she felt. She said she had no anxiety about the
                                cat, although some anxiety around the idea she had no anxiety over the cat. We moved
                                nearer to the cat, with each interval I asked her how she felt. Still she was fine. At
                                around five meters away the cat came towards me, ran between my legs and then ran on.
                                The whole time she was fine and felt no anxiety. Her husband later told me that this was
                                a radical change and she would have previously screamed and cried at the thought of
                                going near a cat. Thus I consider this cat to be a good example of how effective BWRT is
                                both in terms of time and effect.</p>

                            <p>The purpose of this case example is to demonstrate how sessions are approximately
                                conducted with regards to clients looking to manage anxiety. </p>

                            <p>Client TN (aged 36) came to see me regarding experiencing continuous overwhelming
                                anxiety. Upon our first meeting she was clearly distressed and told me she had been at
                                some time. Her anxiety had become so bad that it had even brought on a significantly
                                early menopause. </p>

                            <p>Before our first session I have all my clients complete an initial questionnaire. It is
                                usually only a few pages in length. Hers was dozens of pages in length and consisted of
                                drawings, timelines and really the full experience of what she was feeling. TN had
                                apparently once seen a psychiatrist but found it had not helped her a great deal. She
                                was on no medication related to anxiety, but had tried venlafaxine (75mgX2 per day) to
                                no help.</p>

                            <p>She was displaying signs of:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Persistent and excessive worry that was uncontrollable in nature.</li>
                                <li>Difficulty concentrating.</li>
                                <li>Chronic tiredness.</li>
                                <li>Insomnia.</li>
                                <li>Erratic physical behaviour.</li>
                                <li>Frantic speech.</li>
                                <li>High alertness.</li>
                                <li>Paranoia</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p></p>
                            <p>The following case demonstrates the approach undertaken to alleviate the above issues as
                                well as my approach to treating anxiety. </p>

                            <p>I would recommend anyone looking to understand my methodology with regards to managing
                                general anxiety to read this case. Please note that everyone’s anxiety is different and
                                complex, so the approach used between clients will vary.</p>

                        </div>

                        <div class="case-session" id="case2-session1">
                            <p>Given that the client was in a highly anxious state when she walked into the office, I
                                took some time to calm her down and then allowed her to discuss the initial
                                questionnaire, her life and what she believes her issues to be. It was very apparent the
                                client needed an opportunity to vent her frustrations as she had no immediate outlets to
                                do so. She also had little opportunity in her life to have an in-depth discussion on her
                                issues, and virtually no opportunity to plan a strategy to help cope with said issues.
                                Given she was supportive of the therapy but had some difficulty with trusting others, It
                                was therefore important to first build a trusting relationship between us.</p>

                            <p>We then took some time to break down all the aspects of her life that were troubling her
                                and then to break them down into a brief of why they were problems. To do this we first
                                attempted to separate these problems into their individual sources. I then had her
                                discuss why they were problems and what had caused them to manifest in the first place.
                                This is one of the first things a client and myself will do when we start therapy.</p>

                            <p>We started with her career. TN worked as a personal assistant for a very senior level
                                manager within the education sector. She considered it to be a high stress environment.
                                Despite being paid a good salary, TN felt she was being tormented due to a series of
                                factors. She considered her boss to be a highly controlling, childish and a wealthy
                                individual, who repeatedly asked her to do tasks outside of her scope of work. This
                                involved getting her to do menial tasks such as using her to collect his dry cleaning,
                                babysitting his children and most egregiously using her as a personal life counsellor
                                for any issues he had going on in his life. </p>

                            <p>TN believed her boss acquired the job through nepotistic means, the evidence for this
                                being that her boss would contact TN at the slightest issue and seemed incapable of
                                functioning or problem solving on his own. She considered him to be useless at his job
                                and suggested he had no desire to better himself. </p>

                            <p>TN informed me that in many respects he saw her as a surrogate mother figure due to
                                having a virtually non-existent relationship with his own mother. When asked if it would
                                be possible to alter this dynamic with her boss via discussion, she stated it would be
                                extremely unlikely to get any kind of change as he was much too arrogant and self
                                centered to acknowledge the situation.</p>

                            <p>In addition, she considered her home life to be somewhat tumultuous as well, given her
                                husband’s propensity to drink heavily on the weekend and sometimes during the week. This
                                was causing an excessive strain upon the marriage and had resulted in a significant
                                amount of arguments between the two of them. TN suggested her husband might have a
                                drinking problem and that his depression was becoming too tiring for her to deal with.
                                TN identified these two points as being main defining factors for the current anxiety in
                                her life.</p>

                            <p>She also suggested mental illness ran in her family. Her sister is a diagnosed
                                schizophrenic and her mother was described as being highly anxious and narcissistic in
                                nature. TN stated she had a poor relationship with her mother and had really always had
                                a poor relationship with her. </p>

                            <p>When asked what she wanted to achieve with these sessions she replied simply with to
                                reduce her anxiety and this was really her only priority. In terms of managing her
                                anxiety in the past TN had tried medication but had found it very difficult to stay on
                                it, and after a few months weaned herself off. She approached me for help recently after
                                coming off the anti-depressants and stated under no circumstances did she want to take
                                medication, stating they had only made the anxiety worse and had significant physical
                                side-effects.</p>

                            <p>It was unknown upon meeting whether all of her anxiety was caused entirely by
                                environmental factors or to what extent genetic factors were including her mental
                                health. It was however apparent that her husband and her boss were a heavily
                                contributing factor to her anxiety and management over their role in her life would be
                                necessary. To do this it would be necessary to explore the power they have over her and
                                either adjust how they perceived her, to adjust their behaviour or to remove them from
                                her life. To accomplish this part of the therapy we focus on improving
                                self-actualisation and self-empowerment. </p>

                            <p>At the end of the session I set her an advanced goal orientation tool to do over the
                                week. The main reason for this was due to the lack of direction in life as well as a
                                lack of direction in tackling the problems she was facing. Having her list and break
                                down these problems on paper would allow her to explore them more deeply as well as
                                share all the logic strands with me in the next session.It is very important that the
                                client writes down their goals and understands them in order to internalise them as
                                subconscious drivers, otherwise they become little more than fleeting thoughts. They
                                also need to have structured steps thus creating an identifiable path to follow. Such
                                steps should be as small and as manageable as possible whilst still having purpose. We
                                do this relatively early on in sessions so that future sessions have defined purpose and
                                the client has clear instructions on what they should be working towards. </p>

                            <p>Finally I showed her the Wim Hof breathing method. A breathing technique that helps
                                hugely with anxiety. I advised her to practice this technique twice per day.</p>

                        <div class="case-session" id="case2-session2">
                            <p>At the beginning of the second session we discussed the goals she had established and
                                then used this information to create a plan of how we were going to tackle the said
                                listed issues. We debated over how best to tackle the key issues (poor state of
                                employment, anxiety from childhood & poor state of romantic relationship) and set an
                                action plan with a series of goals we would operate upon the next coming sessions. This
                                involved undertaking a series of small steps that would work on improving each one of
                                these issues.</p>

                            <p>Once she was happy with these goals and felt comfortable that she could realistically
                                obtain them we began by addressing her husband’s apparent alcoholism.TN stated her
                                husband’s drinking occured on a daily basis and whilst he didn’t always drink to get
                                drunk he was using it as a coping mechanism and clearly had no control over his
                                addiction. </p>

                            <p>We discussed how it affected her and her family and we both agreed that in order for her
                                to be satisfied with her life we would need her husband to address and attempt to manage
                                his addiction. TN informed me that her husband had never had any form of therapy or
                                intervention for his alcoholism before, but would most likely be receptive to it. We
                                agreed that he should come and meet me at the start of our next session together.</p>

                            <p>We then moved on to her work where she discussed her employer and the unhealthy
                                relationship he had with her. We discussed this in depth and again for brevity sake we
                                determined that she would be most likely unable to change his behaviour and also could
                                not change her role within the company, therefore the most sensible option was to leave
                                and search for another job. She was hesitant to move job given that it paid well, but
                                she agreed it would be too difficult at this point to develop healthy boundaries with
                                her employer. I asked her to work on her CV and to update it and bring it in next week.
                            </p>

                            <p>At this point I went over some tools that would be useful in controlling her anxiety.
                                This included a tool for stress management and some videos. For homework she was to open
                                a dialogue with her husband to come and see me, continue to do the Wim Hof breathing
                                (this was apparently helping her hugely) and to update her CV. Finally, I asked her to
                                write about her childhood and in particular to write about a few memories and moments in
                                her life she had found impactful.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="case-session" id="case2-session3">
                            <p>The third session I first met with TN’s husband CN briefly before the start of my session
                                with TN. We talked privately for around ten or so minutes after which he agreed to come
                                and see me on an individual basis to work on himself. </p>

                            <p>Please note this is a case study based around TN. For information about CN and how we
                                approached managing his alcoholism see case example four. </p>

                            <p>In terms of the session with TN we started by continuing to discuss her work life and her
                                relationship with CN. TN was much happier upon this visit although she still had an
                                anxious disposition. She had redone her CV and after we discussed it and made a few
                                changes TN felt confident in the CV and was happy to start applying for jobs. </p>

                            <p>At this point we discussed her relationship with her family. TN suggested her family life
                                had been difficult from an early age. Growing up with several brothers and a mother who
                                displayed highly narcissistic traits had deeply affected TN, stating the relationship
                                with her mother was poor and would remain so. TN recalled being forced by her mother to
                                sit upon a trash can for each meal where she was given the scraps left by her mother and
                                the rest of the family. She was repeatedly shouted at, demeaned, mocked and ridiculed in
                                her time growing up. It was apparent that TN’s mother had raised her in a highly
                                maladaptive way and had caused significant psychological damage. </p>

                            <p>We discussed why her mother behaviour was the way it was and some potential factors
                                emerged including:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>TN's Mother may have experienced sexual abuse. TN had overheard some brief
                                    discussion on it but no details to confirm.</li>

                                <li>Father leaving home for another woman when TN was young. TN suggested that her
                                    father most likely had quite a few affairs and that she had few memories of her
                                    parents being happy together.</li>

                                <li>This most likely left lasting resentment for women (TN confirmed this).
                                    TN mother had looked for another partner but had been unsuccessful.
                                    This had manifested as TN mother often conducting long periods of silent treatment
                                    towards TN.
                                    In addition she was very critical and judgemental towards nearly all of TN's actions
                                    and behaviour growing up.</li>

                                <li>In addition TN existence was a constant reminder of her husband's betrayal and so
                                    much of malice that TN's mother wanted to enact on TN's father was instead enacted
                                    on her.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p></p>

                            <p>When i asked about her father TN stated she didn’t have much of a relationship with him,
                                he had died when she was 12 and hadn’t seen him a great deal of times since the divorce
                                (TN was 5 at the time). TN and myself agreed that the lack of a father figure in her
                                life and having TN mother’s advice for direction means she had developed a warped view
                                of men. Either resenting them or wanting them to love/ save her. Since TN mother did not
                                know how to help herself, she instead lasted out at the weakest person in her immediate
                                family unit. This being TN. TN states that her mother was far kinder to her son’s (TN
                                has two brothers) and treated them as little princes. Most likely as she would always
                                want them to love her. </p>

                            <p>Despite this TN mother was now very bitter and old and had according to TN driven away
                                her two sons. TN then painted what was now a sad existence for her mother. We discussed
                                these topics in further details but for brevity sake TN left the session feeling she had
                                a far better understanding of her mother’s behaviour which had answered her repeated
                                questions of why she behaved in such a way. This was a necessary step to removing some
                                of the negative self rhetoric in her mind.</p>

                            <p>For homework i asked her to list her most anxious memories and give each a score between
                                10 and 0, where 0 caused no anxiety at all and 10 was maximum anxiety. These anxious
                                memories form the basis for the next part of the therapeutic program which is utilizing
                                BWRT. </p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="case-session" id="case2-session4">
                            <p>This session TN was in a very positive mood. She had sent out her CV and whilst she was
                                still demotivated with work, TN was much more positive about the prospect of change.
                                This was great to see as it was also a manifestation of her mindset towards dealing with
                                her anxiety. Mainly that she would be taking her own life and happiness into account
                                when making decisions focusing on making choices that would empower her.</p>

                            <p>At the point of our fourth session I was also seeing client CN (TN's husband). She
                                acknowledged the marriage had some difficulties to deal with but felt more confident
                                that we could tackle these especially with CN now working through his issues.</p>

                            <p>It became apparent that BWRT would be the next appropriate therapy to use as the anxiety
                                caused by memories of the past was key to the chronic anxiety TN was dealing with.</p>

                            <p>At this point I changed focus on how to deal with TN anxiety and continued our sessions
                                in case example three.</p>

                                <p>This is a continuation of the sessions conducted with client TN in case 2.
                                    The information from case example two is not necessary for the understanding of my
                                    methodology regarding managing a client’s
                                    childhood trauma by use of the BrainWave Recursion Therapy (BWRT).
                                    If you would like to read the full case in its entirety start from case two.</p>
                            </strong>

                            <p>Client TN had previously stated she had a poor relationship with her mother, describing
                                her as being narcissistic and manic in nature. At this point in our work together TN now
                                had some understanding of her mother’s behaviour and was motivated to overcome the past.
                                However, her mother’s judgemental rhetoric was clearly deeply ingrained in her mind, so
                                much so that it had become part of TN personality, affecting her every action. This
                                manifested itself as low self-esteem; a chronic feeling of anxiety and feeling judged by
                                others on a near constant basis. It also had made her quite judgemental of others. </p>

                            <p>In order to overcome these maladaptive traits it was firstly necessary to alter certain
                                mental images and memories, since their continuous reinforcement is largely the reason
                                for these maladaptive traits. This can be done with the BWRT process.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="case-session" id="case3-session1">
                            <p>I asked TN to write down her most anxious memories. I then had TN give each memory a
                                score out of ten where ten is highly uncomfortable anxiety and zero is no anxiety at
                                all. She presented the following memories as causing her the most anxiety:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>TN mother conducting silent treatment on TN for weeks at a time. TN stated her
                                    mother had ignored her for an extended period of time (as much as 2.5 weeks) and
                                    refused to acknowledge her existence even when she was begging and crying. She did
                                    not have a defined memory but a collection of small clips. </li>

                                <li>Around age 12 having her mother berate her and reducing her to tears, significantly
                                    damaging her self esteem. She had a defined memory for this one.</li>

                                <li>Age 16 Seeing a person get hit by a bus and dying in front of her. This she found to
                                    be shocking and uncomfortable to recall, but it didn’t have any ties to her
                                    self-esteem. </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p></p>



                            <p>Age 16 Seeing a person get hit by a bus and dying in front of her. This she found to be
                                shocking and uncomfortable to recall, but it didn’t have any ties to her self-esteem.
                            </p>

                            <p>We decided the best memory to tackle would be seeing a person die in a bus accident. The
                                reason for this was to demonstrate the efficacy of the therapy with a stand alone event
                                and thus boost encouragement for future sessions</p>

                            <p>At this point we started to conduct the BWRT. Please note that whilst I will explain in
                                some detail the BWRT process, it will not be possible to conduct the BWRT on yourself
                                just following this case example. Much of the effectiveness of BWRT is in delivery, with

                            <p>We decided the best memory to tackle would be seeing a person die in a bus accident. The
                                reason for this was to demonstrate the efficacy of the therapy with a stand alone event
                                and thus boost encouragement for future sessions</p>

                            <p>At this point we started to conduct the BWRT. Please note that whilst I will explain in
                                some detail the BWRT process, it will not be possible to conduct the BWRT on yourself
                                just following this case example. Much of the effectiveness of BWRT is in delivery, with
                                nuances that require a certified practitioner to conduct it effectively. Also please
                                note there are multiple different uses and forms of BWRT, the version described here is
                                for traumatic memories. </p>
                            The first step of BWRT involves the creation of small mental movies or mental constructs.
                            These are seen in one’s mind’s eye and I ask the clients to put in as much detail as
                            possible. When working with memories I ask them to try and remember as many little details
                            as possible. Any smells, details of the individual, what was the client wearing at the time
                            etc. The more fully formed the mental template, the more effective the therapy.
                            <p>Also please note for legal reasons I cannot fully write out the BWRT script, only briefly

                            The way BWRT was used in this case requires three mental constructs to work. The first one
                            is known as the frozen memory. It refers to the mental image in your mind of the negative
                            event. . This can be a memory or your own mental creation. It can be a memory of a single
                            event, a collection of fragments or a fantasy of the worst case scenario you can imagine. We
                            then test to make sure it is the correct negative construct by using a variety of testing
                            methods. The frozen memory/ mental construct should make the client uncomfortable to dwell
                            on.
                            <p>More explanation of how BWRT of bwrt can be found on my website at this link

                                https://www.bwrt.org/ </p>
                            We then create what’s known as the preferred response. This is another memory or mental
                            construct that is the opposite in nature to the frozen memory. It should be something of the
                            ying to the yang in terms of emotional response to the frozen memory. It is usually highly
                            positive in nature and on recall creates a positive sensation, although the type of
                            preferred response we create depends on the nature of the negative association within the
                            frozen memory. Once again I test to make sure this is indeed an appropriate memory and have
                            the client put as much detail as possible into this memory.
                            <p>The first step of BWRT involves the creation of small mental movies or mental constructs.
                                These are seen in one’s mind’s eye and I ask the clients to put in as much detail as
                                possible. When working with memories I ask them to try and remember as many little
                                details as possible. Any smells, details of the individual, what was the client wearing
                                at the time etc. The more fully formed the mental template, the more effective the
                                therapy.</p>
                            To use this case as an example the frozen memory or seeing an individual get hit by a car.
                            This memory caused TN a great deal of anxiety and distress to recall. The memory we used as
                            a preferred response was her relaxing with a cocktail on the beach in Thailand. This
                            preferred response recalled emotions of relaxation and calm.
                            <p>The way BWRT was used in this case requires three mental constructs to work. The first
                                one is known as the frozen memory. It refers to the mental image in your mind of the
                                negative event. . This can be a memory or your own mental creation. It can be a memory
                                of a single event, a collection of fragments or a fantasy of the worst case scenario you
                                can imagine. We then test to make sure it is the correct negative construct by using a
                                variety of testing methods. The frozen memory/ mental construct should make the client
                                uncomfortable to dwell on. </p>
                            The third construct is the future memory/ construct. This is a mental construct that takes
                            place in the future where the problem has been overcome. The reason for the creation of the
                            future construct is to address the issue of how we perceive a problem. We perceive issues in
                            all tenses, the past, present and future so we need to address all three in terms of mental
                            templating. This future construct involves picking an everyday action and modifying how we
                            perceive it. Usually this is a very mundane task, like going for a walk or cooking dinner.
                            <p>
                            <p>The future memory used in the case was TN brushing her teeth tomorrow. Whilst brushing
                                her teeth I had TN imagine letting go of the death of this individual and having her
                                believe that being emotional over his death would help no one and there was nothing that
                                could be done. It was only hindering her. Instead she would be careful to never run
                                anyone over, but ultimately she would let the shock and fear of seeing this person die
                                go. I had her make this very clear and defined in her mind and tested appropriately.
                            </p>

                            To give you another example of the application of the BWRT method I will use the example of
                            myself with my childhood needle phobia, I perceived needles as terrifying on a multitude of
                            levels. I had a traumatic experience as a child with needles that made me uncomfortable to
                            recall (frozen memory/past). I had terrible anxiety and cried when having a needle,
                            reinforcing that needles are indeed painful and scary (present). Finally I had terrible
                            anxiety and panic attacks thinking about upcoming vaccinations and would avoid them at any
                            cost (future).
                            <p>

                            <p>At this point we then ran the BWRT procedure on TN. This is a ten to twelve minute
                                process that involves a mental visualisation journey for the client and involves
                                picturing images and emotions as I direct. The client is awake through the whole
                                process. It involves myself having the client bring up the frozen memory, preferred
                                response and future memory in quick succession in a certain pattern. The purpose of this
                                is to take the emotional response from the preferred response and to overlay it upon the
                                negative frozen memory. This is done several times until the new emotional response
                                begins to stick. When conducted properly the emotion associated with the frozen memory
                                should be hugely reduced to the point that it no longer causes the client any emotional
                                pain to recall. </p>

                            <p></p>
                            <p> After the process is completed we then test the negative frozen memory to see if there
                                is still an emotional response. Part of the initial testing of the frozen memory
                                involves taking something called the perceived arousal level or PAL. PAL is a given
                                score out of ten where the memory causes maximum anxiety to zero where the memory causes
                                no anxiety. The initial PAL for TN memory was a nine out of ten. After the BWRT session
                                TN’s frozen memory had been reduced to three out of ten. I was fairly happy with this
                                result and usually try to get a score between zero and two. However, given the client’s
                                history it was apparent it would take a few sessions of BWRT to really reduce her
                                baseline anxiety to the point where zero and one were a possibility in future sessions.
                                The client was very satisfied with the result. </p>

                            <p></p>This concluded our first session of BWRT. I directed the client to spend some time
                            recalling the frozen memory over the week and to write down the PAL generated when recalling
                            this memory as well as some videos to watch.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="case-session" id="case3-session2">
                            <p> After pleasantries I had the client recall the frozen memory we worked on last week. She
                                did so and scored the memory as still causing a three out of ten in anxiety. This was
                                expected as the score associated with the frozen memory should seldom rise after the
                                first session (I have never personally encountered this issue) and in most cases
                                decreases. However, given that her baseline anxiety was very high normally it was
                                unlikely to reduce over the week. She described herself as feeling lighter as if a
                                burden had been lifted from her and was very happy with the result thus far. </p>

                            <p></p>At this point the next logical step was to work on the other two memories which
                            focused on the relationship TN had with her mother. After discussion we decided on the
                            following goals.</p>

                            <p></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>To remove the anxiety associated with the verbal judging and silent treatment. She
                                    suggested she would like to just let go of the hold these memories have over her and
                                    to just feel neutral about the memory in a similar manner to the BWRT conducted
                                    earlier.</li>

                                <li>To adjust the way she sees her mother, giving her a more neutral association. She
                                    was not interested in forgiving her but she did not feel comfortable allowing these
                                    memories to have a hold over her either. In TN own words she just wanted to move on.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <p></p>We chose the worst memory of her mother's negative behaviour and selected it for the
                            frozen memory. In particular I wanted to look at memories of shame and embarrassment that
                            TN's mother had caused her.

                            <p></p>The memory we used for the frozen memory was on her mother calling her worthless and
                            a failure, telling her to sit on the trash can. It was just the two of them. TN remembers
                            sitting on a trash can and hearing this. Recalling the memory caused TN to cry and it was
                            very apparent this was a very traumatic memory to recall. She gave the memory a clear 10/10
                            in terms of anxiety inducing and was visibly shaking.

                            <p></p>Please note when working with BWRT it is not necessary that we discuss the memory or
                            even that you tell me the memory. The only thing that matters is that you can visualise a
                            negative image in your mind’s eye. If you would like to keep the details of the event to
                            yourself you may do so.

                            <p></p>For a preferred response we used the same preferred response as before and picked a
                            different future memory of TN walking her dog. We conducted the same process as before and
                            afterwards we again tested the level of anxiety associated with the memory. The score this
                            time was a two out of ten. I was happy with the result.

                            <p></p>We concluded the session there. I set her some further tasks and preparation for
                            level 2 BWRT. The next session would be focused on improving her damaged self-esteem which
                            was the last key issue TN stated she had wanted to tackle. Since the poor self esteem was
                            mainly around how her mother had treated TN, it was important for us to first: understand
                            her mother’s behaviour as best as possible; remove the barriers of her mother’s control with
                            BWRT and to convince TN on both a conscious and subconscious level that it was possible to
                            change her personality.
                        </div>

                        <div class="case-session" id="case3-session3">
                            <p></p>At this point I had been working with client TN for some time and now knew a great
                            deal of her past. When dealing with past trauma it is important for the client and myself to
                            work together to draw an accurate picture of how the client’s past was and what is the
                            correct mindset by which to now view these past events. This is why I did not attempt to
                            improve TN self esteem until we had: made progress over accepting and overcoming her past;
                            taking steps to improve her career; taking steps to improve her health and working on her
                            relationship with her family.</p>

                            <p></p>Through my conversations with TN we had established the following about her self
                            image:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <p></p>TN mother was controlling and displayed narcissistic tendencies. TN suggested
                                    they got considerably worse after TN mother had found out about an affair between
                                    TN’s father and a woman he worked with.
                                </li>

                                <li>
                                    <p></p>After finding out about the affair, TN’s mother’s had become increasingly
                                    more abusive and paranoid. She distrusted other women and became controlling over
                                    her kids as a coping mechanism. As a maladaptive method of control she had become
                                    overly judgemental and critical. This manifested as an abusive parenting style which
                                    TN had sadly had to bear the brunt of.

                                <li>
                                    <p></p>The effects of this abuse were permanent on TN due to the duration of the
                                    abuse (all throughout childhood), the frequency of the abuse (most days) and the
                                    respect she gave to these criticisms due to them coming from her mother.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <p></p>This abusive attitude towards her had left lingering effects on TN. These had
                            manifested as low self-esteem, anxiety, fear of failure, distrust of others, paranoia and
                            depression.

                            <p></p>The effects of this abuse were permanent on TN due to the duration of the abuse (all
                            throughout childhood), the frequency of the abuse (most days) and the respect she gave to
                            these criticisms due to them coming from her mother.

                            <p></p>For this version of the BWRT process, we have the client take the negative self-image
                            the client has of themselves and then overlay a positive hero image over on top of this
                            negative self image within the mind’s eye.

                            <p></p>I asked TN to picture herself looking into a mirror and seeing a version of herself
                            displaying all her most negative traits. For TN’s negative self-image she imagined herself
                            as being: weak, unworthy, unlovable and boring. Her mirror self looked old, tired and sad; a
                            miserable version of herself. I asked her what primary colour this negative self image
                            brought to mind and see said a dark grey. This negative self image reflected how she thought
                            of herself repeatedly throughout the day. It was a filter by which she viewed all of her
                            actions and behaviours. As a result she continuously felt she was not good enough to be in
                            the presence of others and constantly doubted her own opinions and decisions. This false
                            self image had affected everything in TN life, from her approach to relationships, to her
                            career and even to the way she stood. At this point I asked her how the image felt to her.
                            She was clearly uncomfortable and said it made her feel very sad to picture.

                            <p></p>At this point we created the positive superhero imagery. I had TN imagine herself
                            still looking in the mirror but this time seeing a powerful wonder woman version of herself
                            standing tall. This wonder woman version of her was filled with confidence and happiness. I
                            asked her what positive colour she associated with the image and she replied gold. When
                            asked how this image felt, TN was smiling stating it made her feel happy, hopeful and proud.

                            <p></p>Finally I had her create what is known as the future memory. This is an ordinary
                            event that a person does everyday. In this instant she picked brushing her hair, but it
                            could have also been making breakfast or going for a run etc. During this future memory I
                            had her imagine leaving behind her past self and really acknowledging she had changed. I
                            then had her add some details to this mental image of her brushing her hair. Within this
                            future image she was a changed woman, who was more relaxed and confident in herself. imaging
                            herself as a changed woman, thus ingraining it in her subconscious. We tested accordingly
                            until she said she could clearly see this imagery in her mind’s eye.

                            <p></p>At this point we ran through the BWRT process. This involves her visualise the
                            negative weak version of herself transforming into this more powerful version of herself and
                            then directing her mind to the future memory where she had changed as a person. This is done
                            repeatedly, very quickly whilst the client had their eyes closed. Afterwards I put TN into a
                            relaxed state for a few minutes, whilst her mind adjusted. This whole process, including
                            creation of mental images and the relaxation period, takes around 40 minutes.

                            <p></p>We concluded the session and I asked TN to give it a couple of weeks before seeing me
                            again, allowing her some time to notice the level 2 transformation, which unlike BWRT level
                            1 work can take some time to take effect.

                            <p></p>After this session I continued to work with TN further alongside her husband for some
                            marriage counselling and on and off in the future that doesn’t need to be written about.
                            However if you would like to know how TN therapy was concluded, TN received a job offer a
                            month after sending out her CV and was very happy with the move. After some marriage
                            counselling her relationship with CN greatly improved and CN decided to abstain from alcohol
                            for the foreseeable future. The BWRT removed a great deal of her anxious tendency and
                            allowed her to function without being plagued by memories of the past. Her personality
                            became noticeably more upbeat and confident, and hopefully will remain as such.

                            <p></p>We continue to maintain occasion contact and I am satisfied with the results from the
                            counselling.

                            and self-esteem issues. One of the contributing factors to TN issues was her husband’s abuse
                            of alcohol. CN met with me as part of my work with TN and decided he was interested in
                            reducing the amount of alcohol he was consuming.

                            CN agreed to see me in regards helping TN with her anxiety but after spending some time with
                            me agreed to come independent of TN and work on his alcoholism and depression.

                            multitude of different mediums. Recently he described himself as feeling uninspired and
                            lacking in motivation. He believed that he drank moderately to excessively.

                            <p></p>Upon asking about CN history with alcohol he described drinking alcohol at the age of
                            eleven for the first time and drinking frequently by age fifteen. He had had sporadic
                            periods of quitting for varied durations (the longest was 9 months) but always returned at
                            some point. When asked about why he drinks he said he didn’t know but that he tended to
                            drink more if he was bored, sad or angry. This is quite common statement, as substance abuse
                            is often a crutch to deal with difficulties in life. Individuals displaying addictive
                            tendencies will most commonly turn to their substance of choice both in times of celebration
                            (to get a bigger high out of an already high moment) or when something negative has happened
                            to them (to console themselves). They are also frequently looking for validity from the
                            other individuals around them that it is okay to drink. Addiction is partially this is due
                            to a chemical mechanism within our minds and partially due to a need to dissociate from
                            reality. In this regard CN described himself as being no different.

                            <p></p>CN also described himself as depressed and scored a 18 on the Hamilton Depression
                            Index when tested (this is a questionnaire that measures the degree of severity of
                            depression, an 18 being the high end of moderate depression). Given that alcohol is a
                            depressant and takes around 25 days to fully leave your body, this was no surprise.

                            <p></p>At this point I outlined what I believed the best strategy for CN would be with
                            future sessions:

                            <ul>
                                <li>To improve understanding of alcoholism and to understand what factors caused him to
                                    increase his drinking/ create a drinking problem in the first place. </li>
                                <li>To understand the biological mechanism of addiction in general.</li>
                                <li>To then separate himself from the addiction as a separate entity and create a new
                                    mindset for himself which doesn’t involve alcohol.</li>
                                <li>To use BWRT to solidify these changes in the subconscious mind.</li>
                                <li>In tandem to this we would be structuring a regiment where CN could take back
                                    control of his life. This daily routine would focus on giving him a sense of purpose
                                    and inspiration. We decided this would be best done with the pursuit of honing some
                                    constructive skills, routine and self-actualisation.</li>
                                <li>CN agreed to the structure. After the session I sent CN an email directing him to
                                    work on his knowledge of addiction and to complete a goal orientation exercise.
                                </li>

                                <p></p>I also directed him to the following lectures given by Dr. Carran
                                (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kpOod1xlb0)</li>

                                These lectures are filled with extremely useful information on dealing with addiction
                                and I advise all individuals dealing with addiction or knows someone with addiction and
                                wants to help to watch them.
                        </div>

                        <div class="case-session" id="case4-session2">
                            <p></p>At this point CN returned the first part of the goal orientation I set him. The tool
                            is designed to help the client identify: where they are currently in life, what they want to
                            achieve in the future and what pitfalls they should be mindful of. This gives you something
                            of a compass which the client can follow. In addition it highlights what you really want to
                            avoid in life and what would be the worst things to lose. This creates both the carrot and
                            the stick to motivate the client. </p>

                            <p>CN identified as losing TN as the worst thing that could happen to him as well as falling
                                deeper into alcoholism. He would lose the support of his loved ones and friends;, and
                                would most likely be alone, bitter and poor. It was a possible future and perhaps even a
                                likely one if he didnt start to manage his addiction. He considered not being able to
                                work on something he was passionate over about being one of his main fears. </p>

                            <p>In terms of where he felt he was presently, he identified himself as being a failure of
                                an artist and was a let down both to himself and his wife TN. He stated he felt
                                demotivated and despite feeling like he knew how to change he could not. Most days he
                                would spend around the house, doing little more than procrastinating. His sleeping
                                pattern was poor and he did not have much structure to his sleep schedule. In general he
                                slept quite a lot (10 -14 hours per day).</p>

                            <p>In an ideal future CN wanted to be a successful artist, to make those around him proud.
                                He wanted to be more confident in himself and in his art. He also wanted to be more
                                talented at being an artist, wanting a wider range of art types and styles. He of course
                                wanted to be in control of his drinking, to kick the depression and to make his wife
                                proud. </p>

                            <p>CN described having a realisation whilst writing out the tool, stating that he would need
                                to be prepared to change his thinking if he didn’t want his situation to deteriorate. He
                                also said if he had any hope of being an artist he was going to need to try harder and
                                be smarter about the process. He also had begun to see why his neurosis and his
                                depression had contributed to his wife’s anxiety and how now he could tackle it. This
                                kind of realisation is exactly what I had hoped CN would see in the tool and set us up
                                well for further progression. </p>

                            <p>At the end of the session I advised CN to finish the addiction lectures and to write down
                                some memories of drinking and having a great time, as well as what he enjoyed about
                                drinking. I then advised him to write down bad memories of drinking and what he thought
                                was negative about his drinking. I also asked him when was the last time he enjoyed
                                drinking and what is the ratio between him enjoying himself drinking and him not.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="case-session" id="case4-session3">
                            <p>At the start of the third session we went over the answers to above questions. He had
                                written that he enjoyed the social side of drinking and that his best memories were of
                                drinking with friends. When asked about the ratio he suggested it was probably 1/10 on
                                the amount of times he enjoyed himself drinking to how much he didn’t. He said it has
                                been a while (more than a few months) since he had enjoyed drinking. He said he spends
                                more time drunk, at least intoxicated than he does sober. </p>

                            <p>These realisations were tough on CN and this conversation was upsetting to him however
                                they did inspire him to continue to work on himself now and to tackle his addiction head
                                on. CN had not really viewed himself as an alcoholic but rather as someone who used
                                alcohol to deal with his depression and just needed to get control back. </p>

                            <p>He was however apprehensive to quit alcohol completely, rather instead wanting to be able
                                to drink socially within reason. Getting control over an addiction is of course a very
                                difficult thing to do and I usually prefer to instead have the client cessate from using
                                the substance they are addicted to. In his current state I saw no way CN would be able
                                to control his addiction and I suggested we do a trial with no alcohol for a month and
                                then review the situation. He agreed to this. </p>

                            <p>The ability to overcome and comfortably manage addiction can be heavily influenced by
                                trauma in the past. An individual who has experienced great trauma or chronic trauma
                                will feel the need to dissociate and numb any painful emotions associated with the
                                memory of the trauma. Usually (not always) there is a reason why individuals have the
                                need to get high and why they continue to do so. </p>

                            <p>CN suggested he had traumatic experience in his childhood that he found difficult to
                                contend with. CN then discussed how he had been sexually molested as a young boy and
                                believed that it was still causing him trauma to this day. He agreed the best thing to
                                do would first be to manage the resulting trauma of the sexual assault first, and
                                continue the treatment for alcoholism and depression in the background.

                            <p>At this point we moved on to BWRT therapy (more details of BWRT can be found on my BWRT
                                page here and in Case two and three, from brevity sake I will not overly repeat the
                                process here).

                            <p>When working wih sexual assault and BWRT, the negative memory we will look to change is
                                the one that has the most negative association with it. This is nearly always the event
                                of the sexual assault itself. If the client cannot recall the details clearly we will
                                add some extra elements to the mental construct to give it some level of coherence in
                                the mind. The point is to have the client bring to mind the worst part of this
                                experience and to feel the attached negative emotion. </p>

                            <p>Through this we can see that the client has both the mental image in their mind and as
                                well as having them feel the associated negative emotion. The memory has power over the
                                individual because it has such a strong emotional association. By removing the
                                associated emotion, the memory no longer has power over the individual in nearly the
                                same way. As a result the client can now revisit the memory without the same level of
                                pain, therefore they have some control over the experience and thus relief. </p>

                            <p>Upon having him recall the memory TN scored it a 10/10 in uncomfortableness (where ten is
                                maximum discomfort) and he was visibly shaking. Note: I only have the client spend time
                                in the memory for a ten seconds or less just to confirm that we are indeed working on
                                the right memory. </p>

                            <p>To remove the associated negative emotion we overlay what’s known as a preferred response
                                memory. This memory is the emotional ying to the yang. In the cases of sexual assault we
                                are looking for any memory where the client felt clam and happy, preferably in control
                                of the situation. Alternatively, we can use a memory of them overcoming a challenge and
                                feeling positive about that. </p>

                            <p>For TN we used the memory of the sexual assault as the negative memory we wanted to
                                changed (known as the frozen memory) and overlaid a memory of TN succeeding in a
                                football tournament at school (preffered response). </p>

                            <p>At this point we conducted the BWRT process, where I had TN shift between these memories
                                and create the change in association for the negative memory. This process takes around
                                10-15 minutes. Note: during the time TN was fully awake (this is not hypnotherapy), just
                                with his eyes closed. After this was done I put TN into a calm meditative state for a
                                few minutes and then we ended the session. I then had TN score the negative memory again
                                for discomfort, he said a 2/10 or less and was elated with the result. </p>

                            <p>For homework I had TN reflect on the negative memory, as well as had him complete the ABC
                                behaviour worksheet that I set my clients as part of identifying negative behaviour in
                                themselves.
                        </div>

                        <div class="case-session" id="case4-session4">
                            <p>At the start of the session we reviewed the score of the negative sexual assault memory
                                (now a 1/10 in discomfort) and go through the ABC behaioural sheet. In this we
                                identified several bad habits that led him to drink or triggered his cravings. </p>

                            <p>At this point CN and myself had now spent a month seeing each other. During which he had
                                been sober for a week. In the first three weeks CN had continued to drink (2 nights
                                first week, 4 nights in the second week) as he suggested he found it difficult to accept
                                he was going to be sober, however he had felt motivated to give up alcohol as part of
                                achieving his goals in the last week, partially to help support his wife’s mental
                                health. </p>

                            <p>During the week CN had been sober he’d described it as being initially difficult for the
                                first four or so days but at this point had begun to feel significantly better. However,
                                he described himself as still having strong cravings (this is of course to be expected).
                                I asked him if he felt this sobriety could only temporarily be maintained and he
                                believed he would struggle to keep sober past the month. To help clients manage cravings
                                the most effective way is to use BWRT. </p>

                            <p>Please note during the first few sessions of therapy the client does not need to commit
                                to sobriety. CN choose to, but it’s only after BWRT on cravings is conducted do I
                                recommend clients try to become sober. This is because the cravings often overwhelm a
                                cesseeding individual back into addiction, creating an idea in the clients mind that
                                they are not capable of quitting. </p>

                            <p>The standard procedure for removing alcohol cravings with BWRT involves having the client
                                imagine a situation where they are having an intense craving whilst pouring themselves
                                an alcoholic drink. They then imagine themselves lifting the drink up to their mouth. I
                                ask the client to save this little mental video hence called the frozen memory. I then
                                have them overlay a mental construct of the individual putting down the drinking and
                                walking away/ doing some other activity (known as the preferred response). In CN’s case
                                it was putting down the drink and playing his guitar. </p>

                            <p>This process is and this should reduce the power of the craving sensation. After I had
                                completed this process with CN we concluded the session.</p>

                            <p>For homework I asked him to reflect on his cravings and to write down whenever he had
                                cravings and at what time. I asked him to also start writing a diary as he had responded
                                well to the writing tasks and had achieved a great deal of self improvement with written
                                tasks.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="case-session" id="case4-session5">
                            <p>In our final session, CN had maintained his reduced drinking for several weeks and was
                                feeling confident about his continued recovery. He had developed a healthy evening
                                routine that included exercise, reading, and spending quality time with TN.</p>

                            <p>We used BWRT Level 2 techniques to strengthen CN's self-image and confidence. His
                                "superhero self" was someone who was strong, capable of handling life's challenges
                                without alcohol, and worthy of love and respect.</p>

                            <p>CN reflected on how much his life had changed in just a few sessions. The trauma that had
                                controlled his life for 25 years no longer had power over him, and he had developed
                                healthy ways to cope with stress and difficult emotions.</p>

                            <p>We established a follow-up plan for periodic check-ins to maintain his progress. CN felt
                                equipped with the tools he needed to continue his recovery and build the life he wanted
                                with TN.</p>

                            <p>This case demonstrates how addressing underlying trauma can be key to resolving addiction
                                issues. By processing the sexual assault trauma with BWRT, CN was able to break free
                                from the cycle of drinking that had been controlling his life.</p>

                            <p>MV was at the time a 32 year old female presenting with symptoms associated with
                                dysthymia, or persistent depressive disorder. She experienced most of her day in a low
                                energy state, feeling a combination of sadness, lack of focus, and a lack of motivation.
                                She referred to herself several times as hopeless and didn’t see anyway her life was
                                going to improve anytime soon. </p>

                            <p>This lack of demotivation was causing her to struggle at work, and though she was afraid
                                of losing her job, she was also apathetic given that she simply did not have the mental
                                fortitude to continue. She was clearly very intelligent and creative but was struggling
                                to manage her life and had been for some time. </p>

                            <p>She had previously seen a psychiatrist and was prescribed sertraline (Zoloft) 50mg per
                                day. She informed me she did not like taking it, feeling It caused largely negative side
                                effects (dizziness, insomnia and nausea). </p>

                            <p>She placed part of this depression around dealing with fibromyalgia as well, and was in
                                almost continuous pain. </p>

                            <p>This case may be interesting for anyone dealing with: </p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Depression.</li>
                                <li>Lack of motivation.</li>
                                <li>Feelings of hopelessness.</li>
                                <li>Lethargy.</li>
                                <li>Lack of personal sense of purpose</li>

                            </ul>
                        </div>

                        <div class="case-session" id="case5-session1">
                            <p>I started by asking MV what she was looking to achieve in these sessions. MV stated she
                                wasn’t sure and that she had no idea how to make herself feel better or how to enact a
                                plan. She stated that she was hopelessly lost. At the time she had very little
                                motivation and it was apparent that just the conversation with myself was draining for
                                her. It was also apparent MV had been depressed for sometime as she talked with some
                                blasé on how she could not be fixed. According to her this was the way life is supposed
                                to be and though she has tried to do everything others had recommended she had never
                                really felt any better. </p>

                            <p>With this in mind for the first session we discussed the nature of her depression, where
                                she believed it came from and why it had become a problem now. Of course the
                                fibromyalgia played a large part, however aside from this she did not have any clear
                                idea of why she was depressed. According to her, work at her company was fine, and she
                                seemed to fit in well there. She was happy with her relationship and with its
                                progression so far so she did not consider this an issue either. </p>

                            <p>I then asked if she had any traumatic memories that could be causing her to feel
                                depressed. Whilst she could produce some negative memories that had occurred in her
                                past, she did not believe they caused the depression. The passing of a grandfather the
                                previous year had been hard on her, but again she did not believe that it was the
                                primary cause. When delving into the history of her youth there was no particular event
                                which struck me as being traumatic, at least to the extent that would cause depression
                                further in life. </p>

                            <p>When asked why she felt discontented in her life, a reoccurring phrase was ‘not living up
                                to expectations’ and ‘letting herself and others down’. We completed the Hamilton
                                Depression Index together (a test which measures the severity of a client’s depression
                                and in this case suggesting she had a moderate depression scoring) and then moved on to
                                a discussion about other areas of her life she thought might be lacking. Throughout this
                                period the client divulged details of her life and made some note on feeling like she
                                was missing on fun and on her career.</p>

                            <p>Throughout the conversation It became apparent that MV’s life goals were poorly
                                structured and she had little direction. She had no real idea on what she wanted to
                                achieve with her future. She also didn’t have a daily routine structure. As a result she
                                had little to motivate her each day and found herself just going through the motions of
                                living.</p>

                            <p>At this point we had spent an hour together and wrapped up the session. I set her a goal
                                orientation task to do for homework, a life wheel tool to complete and a video on Wim
                                Hof breathing to practice (this is a breathing technique that boosts mood and energy, I
                                usually teach it to clients with depression or anxiety at the end of our first session,
                                see the breathing page on the website for more details). I also set her a series of
                                basic stretches to do in the morning and encouraged her to go on at least one walk per
                                day outside and to go for a walk when she found herself in a low mood. Given MV’s
                                fibromyalgia this exercise routine was designed to be stimulating but not excessive.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="case-session" id="case5-session2">
                            <p>MV returned the following week having completed the goal orientation tool and practiced
                                the Wim Hof breathing a few times. She stated she felt a little better and had found
                                some motivation but very sporadically. I asked her what thoughts had triggered the
                                depressive periods throughout the week. She said her thoughts had been mainly around her
                                negative self image, feelings of hopelessness and a general difficulty caring in having
                                a quality life. </p>

                            <p>At this point we went through the goal orientation tool, where it was apparent that the
                                client felt lost at what she wanted to achieve and didn’t have a single focused goal to
                                move towards. They were vague in nature from ‘just be happier’ and ‘care less about the
                                judgment of others’. Given the vague nature of these goals within her head and a lack of
                                steps taken to achieve them, it was obvious why they had not come to fruition. </p>

                            <p>We sat and brainstormed some things she might want for herself. In general I try to set
                                thematically goals based on duration rather than concrete ones. For example instead of
                                saying, I will lose 10kg of weight, instead to say I will make these next two months the
                                theme of healthy living and where possible and comfortable I will make healthy choices.
                                The reason being such goals are less likely to dissuade you if you start to fail or fall
                                behind. We can further add some concrete goals like 20 minutes of exercise per day or
                                only one piece of junk food per day to give some more understandable direction. Also the
                                reason we choose a small duration is we want the goal to feel present and achievable
                                (hence why it’s one/two months of the healthy theme and not a year, as a new years
                                resolution might be).</p>

                            <p>In terms of bettering one’s life, there are several things humans need to be satiated and
                                what said things are is of course highly debatable. However there is unanimous agreement
                                on some things. We need:</p>

                            <p>Our health: so one should focus on the power of healthy living and exercise.</p>
                            <p>Personal growth; we need to feel we are progressing with our career or our personal
                                development. </p>
                            <p>Love: we need the love of those around us and to feel comfortable in who we are.</p>
                            <p>Social; we need interaction of some others to have pleasant conversations.</p>
                            <p>Creativity: we need something we can be passionate with that is just for our own sake
                                that we can develop. This would be a hobby.</p>
                            <p>Self acceptance: To accept who we are, with an unbiased understanding of our flaws and
                                their origins. </p>
                            <p>With this in mind we decided to keep her goals relatively small in nature so as to keep
                                them obtainable within a small period of time. These were to:</p>

                            <p>Spend the next week making more decisions that result in bettering herself. This would
                                involve doing something constructive when she had the energy and to make healthier
                                eating choices for the week. When posed two choices, MV would attempt to take the one
                                that was more beneficial to her physical and mental health whenever possible. </p>
                            <p>To write about events from his life that she feels affected her, for the purpose of
                                identifying themes, mindset changes and triggers. </p>
                            <p>To knit a pair of socks over the next month (a hobby she had wanted to try)</p>
                            <p>We also created a daily routine that MV was happy to follow. This included:</p>

                            <p>Some form of exercise/ yoga each day. This only needed to be for 10 minutes but what was
                                important was that she did this every day. </p>
                            <p>Wim Hof breathing process at least once per day, but with an aim of three times per day
                                (morning, noon and night)</p>
                            <p>Hot and cold showers turning the water drastically between hot and cold temperature for a
                                duration of 10-20 seconds several times (this technique has shown marked improvement in
                                depressive symptoms) </p>
                            <p>Some time for learning something new if possible. This was to take somewhere between 10 –
                                60 minutes depending on how MV felt that day and could be regarding anything she so
                                chooses. </p>
                            <p>I also advised her to devote some time into a creative hobby if possible. She didn’t have
                                a creative hobby but decided she would give something new a try, and suggested knitting.
                                Knitting being a constructive hobby with growable skills made a lot of sense as a way of
                                fulfilling a creative outlet. </p>

                            <p>The difficulty in maintaining a routine is that it must be something that feels both
                                challenging whilst being enjoyable. It should never be so difficult that you resent it
                                and want it to stop. The very best routines are ones that you are excited to do each day
                                and you feel effectively boost your mental health. </p>

                            <p>We concluded the session with MV feeling pretty determined to give the routine a go,
                                given that she considered it to be manageable and exciting..</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="case-session" id="case5-session3">
                            <p>MV came describing mixed success but happy with her progress so far. She suggested
                                certain elements had been easy and others less so. Whilst she had managed to complete
                                the Wim Hof breathing and the hot/ cold showers each day, she had spent less time
                                knitting than she had hoped, as well as completed 3 days out of the intended 7 for yoga
                                practice. </p>

                            <p>However as mentioned she was happy with the result stating it was her most productive
                                week in years. She described herself as also feeling disappointed initially at her lack
                                of progress at the start of the week, but decided to not guilt trip herself and to just
                                do what she felt she could. After accepting this she said her productivity had started
                                to climb as the week continued. I was very happy with this attitude and whilst we didn’t
                                hit all the targets MV was clearly enjoying the routine. </p>

                            <p>She described herself as being eager but still lacking in motivation on some level. We
                                had at this point discussed life philosophy in some depth. In order to have the
                                motivation to reach one’s goals one needs to be able to present reasons why they should
                                bother trying to obtain any goal in the first place. </p>

                            <p>In MV’s case the goal to improve herself mental health and feel overall happier should be
                                a high priority goal. Therefore not being motivated for this means there was a issue of
                                personal philosophy that was blocking the way. It was important we explored all avenues
                                of why this might be the case.</p>

                            <p>MV had spoke about her working in only passing before but when I asked her about it she
                                had said the company and work was fine. Clearly not something she felt motivated about
                                but not something that seemed to be troubling her either. When we spoke about her work
                                in a little more detail she said the company was prestigious and was a pleasant place to
                                work in general. Her job was a sales woman for hoteliering. She had taken this job after
                                leaving her previous sales job which she had held for a few years. She had been with the
                                company for 4 years and promoted twice, so there was an established career path. MV had
                                a fairly good rapport with her management and considered some to be good and some to be
                                mediocre. In general whilst she was not overly complimentary of the company, she was not
                                overly negative either. </p>

                            <p>However, during the conversation it had become apparent she had an issue with the type of
                                work. MV had been in sales for around 8 years and said she had not intended to go into
                                sales, but was good at it and found it to be initially an exciting challenge. She had
                                enjoyed seeing her hard work pay off and collecting a pay cheque that was only limited
                                by her ability. When I asked her about selling in general she found it now to pointless
                                and manipulative. She didn’t feel like the product was bad, but the job encourages
                                individuals to bend the truth to make the sale. MV felt like this had been somewhat
                                corrupting to her soul and felt this was now a bad career choice for her. When I asked
                                about her career’s future she was pessimistic, saying this because s what she is now
                                pigeon-holed into this profession and would most likely just go from sales position to
                                sales position with the aim to get the most money possible. </p>

                            <p>It became apparent at this point that work was perhaps the main source of her depression
                                and if MV was going to feel more motivated in life, it would be necessary to switch
                                jobs. This would mean leaving sales entirely. This prospect seemed to both motivate and
                                frighten MV. She felt at this point she had been too pigeon holed into a career type and
                                that leaving at this point would mean she needed to start from scratch again. She also
                                had no idea on what she wanted to do and was worried it could be a financially poor
                                decision. However we agreed we might as well talk about some other career potentials.
                            </p>

                            <p>To her help come up with some sensible career change options I set her career orientation
                                tool to complete, advised her to maintain the routine for the next week with the
                                additional caveat of 5 minutes of silent mediation with a notepad (I ran through the
                                basics of this process with her then). </p>

                            <p>I also asked her to start a journal of her thoughts and specifically around her job. This
                                didn’t need to be completed daily only when she felt she had an interesting thought and
                                wanted to write it down. </p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="case-session" id="case5-session4">
                            <p>MV came in a positive mood and seemed optimistic for the session. We started by going
                                through the career tool. For brevity sake I won’t write out all the questions, but some
                                example are:</p>

                            <p>What are some of your strong skills </p>
                            <p>What are some of your average skills </p>
                            <p>What are your weakest skills/ things you want to avoid?</p>
                            <p>What elements of your current career do you enjoy?</p>
                            <p>What elements of your career do you not enjoy?</p>
                            <p>What previous roles did you enjoy and why?</p>
                            <p>What previous roles did you not enjoy and why?</p>
                            <p>What are some traits you would like in your new career to have? (e.g certain hours,
                                certain amount of responsibility…)</p>
                            <p>This resulted in quite a lot of further analysis which we spent the session discussing
                                (for brevity sake again I will not write out all but just some of the key dialogues
                                here). </p>

                            <p>In general it wasnt that she was necessarily opposed to any form of sale, rather that she
                                didn’t want to be selling anything she didn’t believe in. When we discussed the prospect
                                of her running her own business she seemed excited, but again quite nervous. She
                                described always wanting to do carpentry and laughed off the concept. I asked her if she
                                was interested in making it a business and did she have any talent. She showed me some
                                previously made products, which were to be honest were good, but not outstanding. Whilst
                                they could be sold for money, they could do with some improvement and she acknowledged
                                this. However there was some potential in this business idea if done right.</p>

                            <p>We discussed this business idea in more detail and spent some time working out the
                                cracks. The two most sensible options seemed to be to work on carpentry in spare time,
                                improve her skills and then sell the products whilst she makes the transition.
                                Alternatively to join another carpenter, to shadow them and learn some of the trade,
                                then perhaps create her own business. </p>

                            <p>Some other opportunities included working in operations where she had previously had a
                                job and enjoyed it. Alternatively, she said she would like to work as a florist
                                (although we both agreed this wasn’t likely to make her a great deal of money in
                                relation to the passion she felt for being a florist). </p>

                            <p>We discussed whether she would want to go on to do further education. Whilst there were a
                                few potential courses she would be interested in, given that she had a BSc and another
                                diploma already, it would only make sense to go and do a masters course. Given that she
                                didn’t have a clear MSc course in mind, nor needed an MSc to carry out the job
                                transitions she had in mind, we decided not to keep this as an option. </p>

                            <p>We decided that in the short run we would focus on a shift to operations manager or a
                                projects manager, either in house or a move to another company. This would be an
                                interesting new challenge for her. In the meantime she would work on her wood working
                                ability and try to improve her skills whilst deciding if this would be a career path she
                                would be interested in. </p>

                            <p>We then did a form of BWRT that focused on motivation. For brevity I will just write the
                                basic details of the approach. </p>

                            <p>For more details about the mechanism of BWRT, see case example one and three. Also see my
                                page on BWRT https://ryanmcconnell.co.uk/bwrt/). </p>

                            <p>To do this I first ask the client to conjure up a mental image of themselves, feeling
                                highly de-motivated and overwhelmed. This image should be uncomfortable and tiring to
                                picture. </p>

                            <p>We then overlay a superhero version of themselves that feel positive, highly motivated
                                and proactive. This is done many times until the positive sensation for the superhero
                                image to imprinted on the negative image. This imagery change services as a basis of a
                                more proactive subconscious mind. After completing the BWRT we tested the BwRT which
                                provided a satisfactory result. We then concluded the session.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="case-session" id="case5-conclusion">
                            <p>We continued to meet in the coming weeks where MV slowly transitioned her career. She
                                eventually left her job to join a woodwork company in her home country. She was happy
                                with the move and when we last spoke she felt inspired to keep up this new momentum in
                                her life. Since much of her personal philosophy had been adapted by the culture of
                                aggressive sales, this less target, more creativity focus had really impacted her life
                                philosophy. </p>

                            <p>There are of course many reasons why an individual might be depressed and most likely it
                                is a combination of factors. All clients are treated as individuals and several tests
                                and measures are put in place to help find some of the root causes of the clients
                                depression. </p>

                            <p>Please note: some forms of depression have a root in a chemical deficiency. Some examples
                                of this might be post drug addiction withdrawal recovery or a biological impairment of
                                certain feel good neurotransmitters. In such cases I may recommend you consult a
                                psychiatrist in tandem to our sessions. </p>

                            <p>Thank you for taking the time to read this case example. </p>

                            <p>YR was a forty seven year old African American man from south west America. YR could be
                                described as stoic and skeptical in nature, especially towards therapy. His wife had put
                                us in contact as his anger had become unacceptable to live with. </p>

                            <p>This case example is useful for highlighting how treatment is conducted with an
                                individual looking to manage:</p>

                            <p>War related trauma or trauma of a violent nature.</p>
                            <p>Those who have a skeptical attitude towards therapy.</p>
                            <p>Persistent anger issues. </p>
                            <p>Control issues.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="case-session" id="case6-session1">
                            <p>As mentioned in the initial overview YR wife had put us in contact and he had
                                begrudgingly come to see me. Before any treatment could take place it was necessary for
                                me to convince YR this would be a worthwhile process and therapy would benefit him both
                                in the short run and the long run. Also it would be necessary for me to win over his
                                trust and his respect. Without this response he would be unlikely to follow my advice
                                and thus treatment would fail. </p>

                            <p>As a method of proving the efficacy of my treatment I first presented some previous cases
                                of working with military related PTSD, describing the process used and how it would
                                benefit him. I decided not to ask him any probing or invasive questions in this first
                                session as he would have likely responded negatively. </p>

                            <p>Throughout the conversation it also became apparent YR was a man who valued structure in
                                his routine and would respond well to structured tasks set. However he would be unlikely
                                to divulge any uncomfortable information about himself before he had trust in me and
                                take my advice. It was therefore necessary to start with some simple but routine related
                                work as a method of building some trust and rapport between us. </p>

                            <p>I also purposefully made this session just forty five minutes in duration so as to not
                                overwhelm him or create a tiring feeling to the treatment, since any negative response
                                at this point would most likely see him immediately terminate the sessions. </p>

                            <p>We concluded the session and YR said he would discuss things with his wife and that he
                                might return. Given that it would have been unlikely for YR to have outright said that
                                he would want to continue these sessions this was a positive response and YR personal
                                willingness to want to continue would be much needed for us to have success. In terms of
                                setting work I had him complete the goal orientation tool and design a simple list of
                                tasks he would like to build into his routine. I also had him complete the life wheel
                                tool. Finally I told him to practice Wim Hof breathing (this process is outlined in the
                                breathwork portion of the website). </p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="case-session" id="case6-session2">
                            <p>YR returned with the completed goal orientation tool. To briefly summarise it, he was
                                looking to get rid of the nightmares related to his war induced PTSD and to work on
                                reducing his anger. In addition he stated he wanted to feel more relaxed and calmer.
                                Finally, he wanted to be less confrontational and comfortable in himself. He
                                acknowledged he had some control issues, but only slightly and didn’t seem to want to
                                prioritise working on them. </p>

                            <p>To achieve these goals YR acknowledged he would be prepared to do counselling and would
                                be prepared to make the necessary changes to himself. I was happy with these goals set
                                so we proceeded to talk about why he gets so angry. He replied that he found people
                                annoying and had no patience for their failures. Given that it is human nature to make
                                mistakes as YR does himself make, I asked him why he felt these people should be
                                reprimanded when it’s part of human nature to fail. He replied that their lives are too
                                easy and they need to do better. </p>

                            <p>It was apparent throughout the conversation that the actions YR undertook during wartime
                                had altered how he saw society into a much more totalitarian way. This was naturally
                                going to be an issue so I suggest we discuss his past in the war and try to understand
                                exactly how his time as a soldier affected him both at the time and now in the present.
                                Also it was apparent that YR was also very hard on himself and his own actions, which
                                had now manifested as being hard on others or attempting to overly control the
                                situation. </p>

                            <p>We proceeded to discuss several war stories he had. Many were brutal and involved killing
                                both by YR and happening around YR. In particular one story stood out. YR told me of an
                                incident where he was flying a helicopter. He had received intelligence that within a
                                designated building there was a terrorist group and was ordered to destroy the building.
                                YR used a hellfire round which incinerated all those inside the building. The
                                intelligence turned out to be false and the building was filled with civilians including
                                both women and children. YR watched through the helicopter monitor as several women and
                                children fled the building on fire only to shortly burn to death. YR was clearly angry
                                and overwhelmingly sad when telling the story.</p>

                            <p>I asked YR to what extent did he blame himself for what happened. He placed fifty percent
                                blame on himself stating that he was told to do it, but he was also the one who had
                                opened fire, so he should take the responsibility. Throughout the conversation it had
                                become apparent that not only was YR angry at the intelligence officers and the war in
                                general, but that he was also angry at himself. </p>

                            <p>We further discussed the situation and I proposed the following: that YR should move away
                                from looking for a suitable target to blame as was both indeterminable in nature and
                                unnecessary to do so. He only pressed the trigger because he was ordered to by an
                                intelligence officer who was told they should open fire by a soldier who believed there
                                to be terrorists in the building and most likely there was before. We agreed the soldier
                                who gave the bad intel is only here for political reasons and has no reason to
                                maliciously target civilians, especially not women and children. Ultimately we reasoned
                                it was a bad idea for him to blame anyone, as multiple individuals are both culprit and
                                not culprit in this situation. Though one could argue evil was undertaken by YR, it did
                                not represent who he was or who he was trying to be. Instead he should allow himself to
                                let go of the anger in order to become a better version of himself. </p>

                            <p>I asked him if he felt the need to reach out to the families affected and offer an
                                apology. He said it would be near impossible to do so, to which I agreed. I further
                                asked if he felt it would benefit their life in any way for you to apologize. He said
                                most like no. However we both agreed that he felt the need to make up for his actions.
                                To this we outlined how he could help people in his immediate environment and to help
                                those he knows as well as to help those who reach out when he feels appropriate to do
                                so. He agreed this made sense and would adopt that approach in his life as a form of
                                repentance and thus allowing him to work on self acceptance.

                            <p>Before we continued I once more asked YR if he was prepared to fully forgive himself for
                                the incident and for other incidents of war. This is critical as the self blame would
                                act as a large blockage to changing his perception of the past. He said that he was
                                fully committed to changing and would do his best to forgive himself.</p>

                            <p>For anyone reading this asking whether or not YR should allow himself to forgive him, I
                                would argue the following point. Without a path to redemption for one’s past mistakes,
                                one cannot better themselves. If a person is consumed by their shame they will not deem
                                themselves worthy or capable of change and thus will not change. They are destined to
                                live a life of misery and anger for they cannot accept themselves and hate that others
                                made them feel such shame. Such people cannot help themselves nor do they help others
                                around them, they make the world a worse place to live in by enacting this tragic
                                version of themselves. Shame has been on some level a catalyst for every type of human
                                atrocity ever committed. Shame is a core part of the human psyche and can sculpt any
                                individual into a monster under the right circumstances. In addition even under slighter
                                circumstances the inability to deal with shame will cause an individual to go into
                                denial over their own existence. This manifests as defending illogical arguments about
                                themselves and the world around in often an aggressive or controlling way. </p>

                            <p>Whilst some people are arguably beyond redemption, the opportunity to redeem themselves
                                should be extended whenever, as they are purposeless and cruel without some element of
                                self-acceptance. In the case of YR, he clearly wanted to be a better person and had the
                                potential to do so. To deny him that would make the world a slightly worse place.
                                Therefore self-forgiveness seemed an acceptable strategy. </p>

                            <p>At this point I told YR about BWRT (Brainwave Recursion Therapy) related to PTSD (see the
                                BWRT section of this website for more details on BWRT
                                https://ryanmcconnell.co.uk/bwrt/). You can also look at case 1 and case 3 for a more
                                detailed explanation of BWRT. </p>

                            <p>To briefly explain how BWRT operates with relation to PTSD (note the BWRT process used
                                for CPTSD or PTSD with no defined memory is different to the one outlined here), we have
                                the client think of the negative memory of the trauma occurring and bring as much
                                negative emotion as possible to the forefront of the clients mind. This is done for just
                                a few moments so the memory can be clearly seen in the mind. This negative memory acts
                                as a reinforcing mechanism for the trauma and has continued to do so with frequency
                                since the occurrence of the trauma. By removing the negative emotion from the memory and
                                replacing it with one of neutrality, much of the traumatic memories’ influence is
                                reduced. </p>

                            <p>To get this neutral response, I overlay what’s known as the ‘preferred response’ memory
                                over the top of the negative frozen memory within your mind. This preferred response
                                should be a memory that creates the opposite response when remembered. In the case of
                                PTSD is this usually a calm and relaxing memory of contentment. This is done many times
                                quickly alongside some other techniques to remove the negative emotion associated with
                                the trauma. For YR the preferred response was a memory of sitting with his family and
                                his children at home, where to his description, everything felt just right. This
                                preferred response is then mentalled overlaid repeatedly in the mind using the BWRT
                                methodology over the course of around 10 minutes. After this process is completed I put
                                the client into a relaxed state briefly then test to see if there is a change in the
                                emotion associated with the traumatic memory.</p>

                            <p>After the initial process of the BWRT was completed I had YR bring to mind the negative
                                memory and asked him to give a score out of 10 with how strong he could feel a negative
                                emotion associated with the memory, where 10 is maximum emotional sensation and 0 is
                                none at all. He had initially given the negative memory a 9 out of 10 in emotional
                                strength when I had first asked about the memory. After the BWRT process he gave it a
                                1-2 out of 10 and was shocked by the result. He tried for a couple of minutes to
                                generate an emotional sensation but very much struggled to do so. He could still clearly
                                see the memory in his mind, he just had no emotional sensation alongside it. This is the
                                standard result using BWRT with relation to PTSD. </p>

                            <p>After the BWRT process was completed we ended the session and I encouraged him to write
                                down the other war stories and to discuss how they made him feel. The reason for this
                                being as a way to better understand their effects on himself and for the process of
                                managing such memories with BWRT therapy. He was also to score all out the memories out
                                of ten with regards to their emotional attachment.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="case-session" id="case6-session3">
                            <p>At this point YR had become more interested in counselling and was eager to show me the
                                stories he had written down. Some were new ones and others were discussed before but now
                                in more detail. </p>

                            <p>Proceeding with the therapy we next moved on to working with the memory which had the
                                next highest score. This was another war memory with a negative association of 8 out of
                                10. It was regarding the death of a friend under fire. We repeated the same process as
                                the one used in the previous session on this memory (BWRT needs some time between each
                                use of at least a few hours, so I only do the process once per session with the client).

                            <p>In addition we discussed his marriage. As stated before YR had issues with control,
                                especially with his wife (we will refer to her as TR from here). We discussed why he
                                might be so controlling and he responded he was afraid of losing her. We then discussed
                                how him trying to control her behaviour would only push her more away from him and what
                                his life would look like without her in it. In addition, we discussed how his trauma
                                from the war had created a fear of loss and this was now creating transferences or a
                                fear of loss upon others he loved. Of course as we were both aware one’s experience
                                during wartime is worlds apart from a peaceful civilian life. For YR to be happy it
                                would be necessary that he conquers this fear of loss by coming to terms with himself.
                                If he didn’t he would ultimately ruin his life. </p>

                            <p>For homework I had him write a list of ways this fear of loss might be manifesting in his
                                life. I also had him work on a worksheet designed for negative behaviour recognition
                                (called the ABC worksheet). Finally I asked him to watch this video from Dr. Gottman on
                                what behaviour makes a couple successful and what problems we might cause for one
                                another when we aren’t communicating as we should.

                            <p>YR returned having done the work. He outlined the following problems with his behaviour
                                having completed the ABC worksheet and watched the gottman video:</p>

                            <p>His need to control the situation out of fear of loss had led him to push overs away in
                                life. To try and remedy this, the appropriate response he would try and take would be to
                                let people be themselves and to treat them like individuals. Rather than be overbearing
                                in other people’s lives he would instead focus on his self development.</p>
                            <p>This need to control had manifested as a lot of aggression. We would work on calming
                                techniques and YR agreed he would need to change his mindset if he was going to conquer
                                his aggressive tendencies.</p>
                            <p>He noticed he had been conducting a behaviour called ‘stonewalling’ with his wife,
                                thereby if he didn’t get his way he would block out her requests and largely ignore her.
                                We agreed this behaviour would need to be adjusted by communicating to one another and
                                to try and extend some more patience with her, as she might do so with him.</p>


                            <p>I proposed the idea of symbiosis in the relationship where they would be prioritise
                                helping each other grow and working to make them the best versions of themselves rather
                                than what they wanted one another to be. The way to train this symbiosis would be to
                                bring them in together and have them work on communication. YR agreed to this also
                                (after this session I had a few sessions with YR and TR together where they worked on
                                their communication with one another).</p>

                            <p>After we had established this as future behavioural goals we then moved on to BWRT to
                                complete the last strong negative memory he had of his time at war. This particular
                                memory was of the sucide of a friend. This time we completed the BWRT process but used a
                                feeling of acceptance instead with the memory for the preferred response rather than a
                                memory associated with relaxation. </p>

                            <p>After we completed the BWRT he stated he felt instantly better and had now really
                                acknowledged that he had a fear of sucide after what he had seen and he was now dealing
                                with this feeling. We concluded the session there for the day.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="case-session" id="case6-conclusion">
                            <p>At this point our sessions became focused on marriage counselling (see case six for more
                                details), level 2 work on becoming a better self (see case three) and relaxation
                                techniques (see case two). The process used with YR was approximately the same as the
                                process outlined in these cases so for brevity sake I will not write it all out again.
                            </p>

                            <p>After completing the above work, YR was a radically different person. He seemed more
                                spiritual and at peace with himself. He was very pleasant to be around and appeared to
                                have a very different outlook in life. In fact the reason why I chose YR as a case to
                                write about was because he presented one of the most radical changes I have seen in a
                                person. I asked him why he felt he changed so much, and it largely seemed to be in
                                mindset reinvention. He said that he had initially thought that therapy would be an
                                oppressive experience, where he would be forced to give things up, or change in a way
                                that he wouldn’t want to. In addition he thought it would be a painful experience, that
                                might ultimately be fruitless. By the third session he said he had completely rethought
                                how he felt about therapy and as a result was eager to embrace change. The last I heard
                                from YR and TR they seemed very happy and content. </p>

                            <p>If you would like more details on the case with YR or would like to book a free

                            <p>Client GK was a man in his thirties who came to see me regarding addiction to porn. He
                                stated that he used porn somewhere from two to six times per day. In addition, he felt
                                his pornography preferrence was now become increasingly bizarre and taboo in nature and
                                was uncomfortable with the direction his preferences were moving towards.</p>

                            <p>GK stated that he wanted to be able to use pornography in a healthy manner (once or twice
                                per week). He also wanted to be able to manage his kinks which were centered around BDSM
                                and dominatrix fetishism. At this point he felt he had lost control over his pornography
                                use. </p>

                            <p>This case is useful for anyone who would like more information about how I approach:</p>

                            <p>Pornography Addiction.</p>

                        <div class="case-session" id="case7-session1">
                            <p>For our initial session I spent some time gaining some understanding of GK as a person as
                                well as some insight on the nature of his addiction.</p>

                            <p>GK stated he viewed pornography several times per day nearly always relating to BDSM,
                                domination and shame. When asked why he said he enjoyed the feeling of being controlled
                                by a woman and wanted them to humiliate him. I asked him why he might want them to do
                                that, he replied that he didn’t know but he nevertheless had an attraction towards these
                                ideas.</p>

                            <p>I asked GK if these fetishes were acted out with his wife (named BK). He said no, as he
                                didn’t like the idea of her preforming such acts and didn’t want to have have her
                                associated in his mind with pornography. When asked why he said that he didn’t like the
                                idea of her doing that to him and already felt criticized enough by her. He wanted the
                                woman to shame him to be different each time. I asked him if he would like to feel
                                differently about this association. He said no, at this point he would rather just not
                                have the fetishism. In terms of sex with his wife he wanted to be more satisfied with
                                more vanilla encounters. It was clear there was a wide separation between his desired
                                sex life and the sex life he had with his wife.</p>

                            <p>GK mentioned his wife BK had threatened to leave many times, including saying she would
                                leave him if the therapy with myself was a failure. GK said her behaviour was
                                understandable given how many times he had broken her trust and let her down. </p>

                            <p>GK stated that he had lost interest in having sex with his wife some time ago as their
                                sex was not satisfying his kinks. In turn she had become somewhat reluctant to engage
                                with GK after discovering about his fetishes and sexual behaviour. At one point GK had
                                frequented a prostitute to perform some such kinky acts with him. GK’s wife had found
                                out about this some time later and confronted GK. As a result the relationship between
                                them was becoming increasingly strained. In addition these fetishisms had become known
                                by members of his and her family/ friends and the embarrassment of the situation had
                                caused further strain on their marriage. After talking further we agreed that if he
                                didn’t discountinue his use of pornography then his wife would most likely leave him in
                                the coming year. GK said he wanted to avoid this if at all possible.</p>

                            <p>Please note: I have no judgement or opinion on a client’s fetish and I understand that
                                fetishism is a mechanism outside of conscious control. It is in many ways a
                                manifestation of the subconscious mind and whilst it can be managed, it cannot be
                                ignored. We do not get to choose what we are attracted to. I am however also aware that
                                most people do not view fetishism in such a manner. This can cause individuals with
                                certain fetishism to have social, cultural and familial issues which may need to be
                                resolved. </p>

                            <p>At this point we discussed the treatment plan and we outlined some goals GK could work
                                towards. These goals being to:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Understand his pornography usage and the subconscious mechanism influencing his use.
                                </li>
                                <li>Reduce his pornography usage.</li>
                                <li>Understand and manage his kinks.</li>
                                <li>Repair his relationship with his wife as much as possible.</li>
                                <li>Improve his career.</li>
                                <li>Improve his self esteem.</li>
                                <p></p>
                            </ul>
                            <p>We discussed his past use of pornography and where he believed these fetishes came from.
                                Whilst not having a clear idea, GK stated he believed this kink came from an experience
                                with an ex-girlfriend from his younger days. She had frequently been abusive to him and
                                much of their sex revolved around some element of BDSM, shame and pleasure denial. GK
                                stated he thought about this time a lot and although it had been an abusive relationship
                                he had found his sex life to have been the most enjoyable with this ex. </p>

                            <p>He also said that he had a friend of his sister who was older and frequently tied him up
                                and would play fight with him. This was when he was around 7 years old. Whilst this was
                                not a critical turning in his sexuality GK believed this may be influential. In
                                addition, GK said he had slept with quite a lot of women throughout his life and he
                                spent a great deal of time fantasizing about past sexual encounters with them. </p>

                            <p>I asked if he would want a similar relationship with his wife as he did with his ex. He
                                said no as it would hurt the relationship he had with his wife. In addition he was not
                                happy in this past abusive relationship and was not interested in turning his
                                relationship with his wife into something that resembled that abusive relationship. It
                                was more the affect her behaviour had on his sex life that he missed, not the rest of
                                the relationship. </p>

                            <p>We further discussed his history with pornography. He has found some of his father’s porn
                                at age 12 and whilst frightened was curious and his appetite for its use had been
                                continuous since then. GK said there was no particular memorable moment with regards his
                                use of pornography, although his mother had lightly scolded him a couple of times after
                                finding his pornography. </p>

                            <p>We then spoke about how GK’s pornography use was also tied to his self esteem, creating a
                                continuous negative cycle. This started with him feeling aroused, using pornography,
                                then feeling guilty in terms of its use, but taking some joy in breaking the taboo. This
                                process affects his self image a little. As he took some joy in using he will use again.
                                Later on when GK becomes aroused again he will return to porn as he received some joy
                                from it, thus starting the negative cycle again. The more this pornography was supposed
                                to be restricted to him, the more he craved it’s use, given that it breaks the taboo
                                even more. </p>

                            <p>I asked him if any sexual or physical assault had happened to him. He said no trauma of
                                any real significance had happened whilst he was growing up. </p>

                            <p>At this point we had talked for some time and I set him some homework in the form of a
                                life wheel tool (this is a tool that looks at all areas of your life and helps determine
                                which elements are the most important to work upon).and a goal orientation tool. </p>

                            <p>In addition I asked GK to observe his pornography use this week. This being to record how
                                many times he would used pornography over the course of the week as well as to identify
                                what it was that he felt attracted to, writing it down in detail. I had some idea of
                                what this was already but I wanted GK to really start thinking about his porn use and
                                trying to manage it as a problem in his life, rather than simply something he did when
                                he was bored. </p>

                            <p>Finally, I had him start watching the first episode of Dr. Carran series on understanding
                                addiction. This is the link if you are interested https://youtu.be/-kpOod1xlb0</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="case-session" id="case7-session2">
                            <p>Upon our next session GK was in a positive mood. Having done the homework set, we went
                                through each part. The life wheel measures several areas of the client’s life but for
                                brevity sake we will focus on the areas GK wanted to improve the most. These being; his
                                career (2/10), personal growth (3/10) and his relationship (3/10). He wanted all of
                                these to be an 8/10 if possible. These would be the areas of his life we would first
                                focus on working on.</p>

                            <p>In terms of notes about his pornography use GK identified the following points: </p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>He found himself having the desire to use porn mainly when he was either angry at
                                    his wife, bored or disappointed about something.</li>
                                <li>He had felt more self aware of his kinks and started to find them stranger in
                                    nature.</li>
                                <li>As a result he seemed a little less interested in the kinks (although he was still
                                    turned on by the same fetishes).</li>
                                <li>Having sex with his wife didn't seem to help with porn use. He found himself
                                    thinking about porn whilst having sex with his wife. Also he said he has felt
                                    awkward having sex with her and could tell she did not find that she could relax
                                    during sex.</li>
                                <li>He was not particularly interested in initiating sex with his wife.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p></p>
                            <p>Throughout the last week it had become apparent to GK that his marriage was in far worse
                                a state than he had previously thought. Whilst he did love his wife he felt distant and
                                disconnected from her. His boredom of his sex life had lead to putting in little to no
                                effort in maintaining their friendship and romance. </p>

                            <p>At this point it became apparent that I would need to speak with GK’s wife BK and indeed
                                after this session I scheduled to speak with her (I go on to work further with GK and BK
                                in case eight with regards marital counselling). </p>

                            <p>When looking through the goal orientation exercise, the key goals he listed were:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>To improve his relationship with his wife and have her be proud of him again.</li>
                                <li>To feel like he is achieving something with his career and not wasting his time.
                                </li>
                                <li>To not be a slave to his pornographic usage.</li>
                                <li>To improve his sex life.</li>
                                <li>To feel better about himself as a person.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>After some discussion we decided that we would approach the problem on three fronts:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>To work on his relationship with SH and in particular to work on rebuilding trust
                                    and respect between the two of them. In addition he would prioritize working on his
                                    friendship with her.</li>
                                <li>To minimise pornographic use and create a list of alternatives actions to porn use.
                                    Some examples being to: go on a short walk, do wim hof breathing (see breathing
                                    section of website), exercise, sex, playing an instrument, working on a skill etc.
                                </li>
                                <li>When masturbating I advised GK to minimise his pornography use for some time (2
                                    weeks) and to monitor its affect on his relationship and the attraction to his wife.
                                </li>
                                <li>To work on his physical health with an exercise routine and to work on his mental
                                    health in the form of a journal.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p></p>
                            <p>These goals were considered to be moderately difficult and achievable. GK was satisfied
                                with this approach and endeavoured to work on these three items over the course of the
                                week.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="case-session" id="case7-session3">
                            <p>GK returned having worked on the routine throughout the week. He described the routine as
                                being good although he was still struggling to find the motivation to make changes as
                                well. He suggested he had some success but not as much as he would have liked. He had
                                watched porn several times and had found it very difficult to resist using. However in
                                other areas of his life including his relationship he felt was starting to see some
                                improvement.

                            <p>At this point it was important that we try to understand why GK had the fetishes he had,
                                as well as how we were going to attempt to manage them. To do this we then spent some
                                time discussing what most likely would have created his fetishism towards shame and
                                abuse. After some discussion we agreed one of the reasons why GK was using pornography
                                so frequently as well as why he wanted to be shamed was due to his poor self image and
                                inability to accept himself as well as lack of responsibility taken to rectify the
                                situation. GK stated he had spent much of his time feeling ashamed of himself but had
                                never seen an alternative lifestyle that he would be comfortable living. </p>

                            <p>As GK life had progressed he had become continuously motivated by short term pleasures
                                and instant gratification. This could in some ways be attributed to his career choice.
                                GK was a musician and had had some success in touring. During certain parts of his
                                career the band he was touring with was selling out venues with relative ease. He had
                                played to tens of thousands. At this time GK said he was on something on an emotional
                                rollercoaster and greatly missed some of those highs. He had kept much of this thrill
                                seeking nature and indulgent attitude from this time and felt motivated to get back to
                                this same life in some form or another. This was of course never going to happen. Not
                                that GK could not play to such numbers again, but the lifestyle was never going to be
                                the same as he was older now. He was also married and had some health issues. Such
                                unattainable goals had left GK in a state of depression along with the development of
                                some narcissistic tendencies and bitterness. </p>

                            <p>In addition, he had heavily used recreational substances during this time as well as
                                slept with many women. GK said he often fantasized about the past and previous sexual
                                encounters. When asked GK opening admitted to wanting to relive these days. He
                                considered these experiences to have occurred at a better time in his life. I asked if
                                he had been happy at the time, he says he was conflicted and had struggled with himself,
                                but having sex with woman and being high had been when he felt most comfortable. During
                                this time he had been heavily abusing short term gratification to the point where he was
                                prepared to ignore his self-respect and societal norms. His pursuit of pleasure had
                                ultimately cost him many relationships and lost him many opportunities. </p>

                            <p>There was a clear lack of self-actualisation done by GK over the years, which GK openly
                                admitted to, stating he repeatedly made poor decisions and was often beareated for it.
                                However arguably GH was not given any method so far of redeeming himself for his shame
                                nor a path on how he should change. Criticism is not useful if it does not provide a
                                possible and plausible alternative. He knew what he needed to do to be a good husband,
                                but could not do it due to subconscious drivers</p>

                            <p>It was clear that this repeated need for self indulgences had left GK with some warped
                                views on how to live and how to be happy. This may explain why GK fetishized shame. For
                                example, in a scenario where a person is shamed for some manner the individual either
                                has to accept the shame and admit to it, resolve the shame through debate or deny the
                                shame to themselves and others. In the beginning an individual will try and resolve
                                their shame. If this is not possible however they are forced into going into denial over
                                the situation. This is because we are often further shamed if we admit to wrongdoing. In
                                addition an acknowledgement of wrongdoing forces us to change and work harder on
                                improving ourselves for others. Indeed, it is possible for a person to be in so denial
                                over their behaviour that they refuse to accept it had occurred at all, even to
                                themselves. I believed some semblance of this had manifested in GK personality. </p>

                            <p>GK wife BK had shamed him many times over his use of porngraphy and his affair. GK of
                                course did not want to make his wife unhappy, but at the same time could not alter the
                                sexual fantasies he had. At first he had tried to deny his use and hide it from his
                                wife. When he could no longer deny this was a problem BK had forced him to confront it
                                by threatening to leave him if therapy didn’t work. This shame had become something GK
                                was used to and even comfortable with to some extent. BK’s use of shame to motivate GK
                                to change had been largely unsuccessful and in some ways the wrong approach.</p>

                            <p>There is a counter argument that suggests GK should feel a constant sense of guilt over
                                what he has done, especially with regards to the affair. However the key issue with this
                                is GK will not be able to accept himself, as living with guilt can be overwhelmingly
                                oppressive on an individual’s mental health. This causes a great deal of stress and
                                negative rhetoric within the mind over who he is and how he should act. As GK could not
                                correct negative rhetoric in his head he had to go into a form of denial whereby either
                                other people are wrong, or it’s okay to be shamed. To be around something who is
                                depressed and uncomfortable in themselves is an unpleasant experience for those around
                                them. GK poor mental health was making BK mental health worse and in a cyclical manner
                                they were both making life worse for each other. For guilt to be used effectively it
                                needs to be used as a catalyst for change, rather than an endless form of punishment.
                                Part of the therapeutic process would be a change in the behaviour BK displayed towards
                                GK (see case eight for details).</p>

                            <p>There are some other factors which may have influenced this fetishism. For example GK was
                                often made to feel ashamed of masturbating and so had some association between the two
                                sensations. Whilst it was an abundance of shaming placed on him by his mother, he said
                                he does remember it vividly and being told several times. In addition, often individuals
                                who suffer for sex addiction are exposed to sex at a young age. This was the case with
                                GK who had his first sexual encounter at twelve years of age, with a girl who was
                                fifteen. He said he had greatly enjoyed the experience. Thematically this would fall in
                                line with GK’s desire to be controlled by women. All of these points in combination are
                                most likely the cause of GK’s shame fetishism.</p>

                            <p>At this point it has become apparent that GK needed to improve his self image if he was
                                going to have a mental shift in what he believed was an acceptable way to be treated.
                                The primary method I use to raise a client’s self-esteem is to change the mental
                                template they have in their mind of themselves. This can be done through the BWRT
                                process. </p>

                            <p>Please note for brevity sake I will note go into a full explanation of BWRT. If you would
                                like information on how BWRT works, please see case one (regarding phobia) and case
                                three (regarding childhood trauma and self-esteem) for more extended details. </p>

                            <p>Also please note before doing self esteem work we will use BWRT to remove the negative
                                emotional association from any highly anxious memories the client has. These anxious
                                memories being any memory that creates a highly uncomfortable sensation to recall. GK
                                had no such memories that scored high enough to work on so we did not conduct any level
                                1 BWRT on anxious memories and instead moved directly on to level 2.</p>

                            <p>For my work with GK self-esteem I used the same methodology highlighted in the self
                                esteem case with some slight modifications. Firstly I asked GK a series of questions to
                                determine what is the most negative image he could think of about himself. What are his
                                worst characteristics and actions. I then asked him what does he consider to be his best
                                characteristics and what would the best version of himself look like in his minds-eye.
                            </p>

                            <p>For the BWRT process I had GK bring to mind and picture a sad caricature version of
                                himself. It was sad, pathetic, sex addicted and miserable. I had him imagine looking
                                into a mirror and seeing a small video playing of him seeing this negative version of
                                himself. To picture this image should make the client feel uncomfortable to picture. I
                                then had him freeze this image overlaying a more happy and responsible version of
                                himself over the top. A superhero version of themselves. The BWRT method involves taking
                                this positive imagery and layering it repeatedly over the top of the negative imagery
                                within the clients mind eye. This is done multiple times until the negative self image
                                has the negative emotional response removed from it. After the BWRT process was
                                completed I then put GK into a relaxed state for a short time and then tested the
                                strength of emotional response of the negative image of himself to see if there had been
                                any reduction in its uncomfortableness. GK replied he felt much better and the frozen
                                negative image had little to no emotional response anymore. </p>

                            <p>After the BWRT process was completed we concluded the session. For homework I had him
                                complete the BWRT level 2 worksheet which involves self reflecting on the negative
                                image. </p>

                            <p>In addition I had him work on some other self esteem exercises and a guide on how to
                                manage negative intrusive thoughts.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="case-session" id="case7-session4">
                            <p>GK came to the session quite spirited and motivated to improve his life. He felt much
                                better about himself and had a strong desire to continue working on himself. However we
                                had yet to alter his kink preferences and his fetishism towards shame. At this point the
                                most effective course of action was to use BWRT to remove the mental template GK had in
                                his mind of BDSM and dominatrix fetishism. We would now work on removing the sexual
                                allure of the kink and replacing it with one of neutrality or of disgust.if necessary.

                            <p>Please note once again for brevity sake I will not go into a full explanation of BWRT. If
                                you would like information on how BWRT works, please see case one and case three for
                                more extended details. </p>

                            This requires a delicate touch as we are not trying to remove the desire to have sex only
                            remove the desire for embrassment and shame as a motivator for sex. The apparent issue was
                            the fetishism GK had in his mind could not be replicated by his wife, thus splitting his
                            desired sex life from his actual sex life.

                            <p>In terms of using BWRT with regards to fetishism management, the methodology involves
                                taking the image of fetish into the minds-eye and bringing to mind making it as alluring
                                as possible. To play it as a short video within his mind. I asked him to picture this
                                imagery as vividly as possible. We then freeze this sexualised image. Then a negative
                                image is then overlaid on top of this fetishsized image within the minds-eye. This image
                                might be one that creates a nauseous or bored feeling to recall, an emotion that would
                                be the opposite of arousal. Given that GK addictive image was strongly rooted and he had
                                tried to treat it several.times before we used a previous memory of GK throwing up from
                                alcohol (one of nauseous). We overlaid this imagery many times using the BWRT process
                                until the original arousing image no longer created a sense of arousal. The idea is to
                                remove the attraction to the fetisihisized image, thus dulling the fetish. </p>

                            <p>Please note that couples can be happy without one partner needing to fulfill all the
                                fetishism of the other. However for most individuals in a coupling to feel satisfied
                                there needs to be a mutual attraction for one another and mutual desire to please one
                                another. This should in some ways present itself as a desire to better themselves for
                                one another, both physically and mentally. In addition a drive to become more
                                symbolically involved, to grow together. Without this feeling couples find themselves
                                feeling bored in the relationship believing they are wasting their time on someone who
                                does not fully fulfill them. To keep this sense of desire couples need to be open with
                                one another about what they want and how they want it, as well as why they feel they
                                want it. Excessive use of pornography in a relationship if often a symptom of a couple’s
                                poor communication. </p>

                            <p>In this case GK did not want to feel aroused by such fetishized imagery and did not want
                                to bring the fetisism into his relationship either. Not did he want to be repeatedly
                                shamed and to continue having a low self-esteem. For this reason we both considered BWRT
                                to remove the fetishized image to be the more sensible solution. I won’t necessarily
                                approach other cases regarding porngraphy addiction in the same manner.</p>

                            <p>After this BWRT work we concluded the session. I told him to reflect on the fetishized
                                frozen memory we used. He said he now didn’t find the imagery to be sexy anymore and
                                didn’t feel any strong emotional response to it. </p>

                            <p>For homework I told him to spend a bit of time recalling the frozen memory each day and
                                check how it made him feel. </p>

                            <p>In addition I gave him a variety of CBT activities to work on. I asked him to spend the
                                week working on his career. He wanted to continue to work in music, but in a different
                                manner so I told him to look into some new careers he might enjoy as well to come up
                                with a list of prerequisites.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="case-session" id="case7-conclusion">
                            <p>At this point the main issues affecting GK was the relationship he had with his wife and
                                the future of his career. He said his porngraphy use had decreased significantly since
                                conducting the BWRT. However there was still a great deal of work to be done on
                                improving the relationship GK had with his wife given the cumulative past damage caused.
                            </p>

                            <p>In case eight I work with both GK and BK to help manage and resolve their marital
                                difficulties. I suggest reading case eight for how sessions with GK were concluded. </p>

                            <p>However, to briefly summarise case eight and the end of this case, after working on GK
                                and BK communication and respect for one another over the next few weeks, GK porn
                                reduced further and he felt more comfortable in sharing his preference with his wife and
                                started incorporating more roleplay. Aside from improvements in sex life we also worked
                                further to build GK career and give him a life he could be satisfied with. In addition I
                                used several tools including the Gottman method to identify the mistakes and successes
                                both individuals were making. </p>

                            <p>In addition GK decided to go back to university with the idea of reinventing his career.
                                He wanted to go into sound design and needed a short degree to do so. Given that he
                                already had some experience in this area and he was passionate about sound design it
                                seemed like a sensible option. GK was very happy and motivated with this move.</p>

                            <p>Whilst GK could of course still cheat again the motive to do so has been greatly reduced
                                and when I last spoke them, they both seemed genuinely happy.</p>

                            <p>The following case outlines my rough methodology towards marital counselling. Please note
                                this is also a continuation of case seven where I worked with GK on his issues with
                                pornography. However it is not necessary to read case seven if you would like to
                                understand my approach towards marital counselling, only if you would like some further

                            <p>This case should be useful in advising any prospective clients on how I operate with

                        <div class="case-session" id="case8-session1">
                            <p>As mentioned I was previously seeing client GK with regards his excessive use of
                                pornography, shame fetishism and cheating within the relationship. </p>

                            <p>BK and GK had been married for some time (20+ years) and had been through both big highs
                                and lows in the relationship. Having dealt with her husband’s issues for some time had
                                caused excessive strain on the marriage and whilst BK loved her husband she felt she had
                                consistently redrawn the line in the sand on what she was prepared to accept within the
                                relationship. BK had threatened to leave GK and divorce him should this relationship
                                counselling not worked and was very much at the end of her patience with GK.</p>

                            <p>When working with a couple I am firstly looking for them to be honest about what they
                                perceived to be negative and positive about their relationship as well as to be honest
                                with each other. I start by seeing how the couple operates together for around 20-30
                                minutes and then work on them individually. I do this as it is important to see how the
                                couple communicate with one another as well as to see what the relationship dynamic
                                looks like. Using this as a start I get a small but unbiased window into the
                                relationship. In the case of BK and GK they sat apart from one another, BK seemed
                                frustrated and somewhat jaded whereas GK went from embarrassed to dismissive. However he
                                did also take some responsibility for some issues and stated he did want to change and
                                he wanted to be in the marriage. BK said she also wanted the marriage to work but
                                considering they had tried counselling before she was not that hopeful about the
                                results. </p>

                            <p>We then move on to individual sessions with each client. This way both members of the
                                relationship get the opportunity to be open and honest with how they feel about the
                                relationship. In the first session I will have the client’s just vent and discuss their
                                feelings towards themselves, the relationship and also their partner. I will also ask
                                some questions to get a better understanding of both clients as well as their
                                background. </p>

                            <p>In the case of GK and his wife BK, I had already been working with GK for some time (for
                                details on the case with GK please see case example seven). Since I have discussed
                                working with GK in some depth already this case example will follow more on my treatment
                                with BK or BK and GK session’s together.</p>

                            <p>BK described the relationship from her perspective to me. She had been very happy when
                                she first met and married GK twenty-one years ago, they met not long after college and
                                got married quicky. GK had always struggled with self-destructive tendencies, but BK
                                loved him regardless and found him to be charming, loving and soulful. Originally she
                                had loved his rockstar attitude and lifestyle as well but felt it was juvenile now and
                                she had moved on and didn’t want him to be stuck in the past either. This was especially
                                true now GK was no longer working frequently and to small venues.</p>

                            <p>The affair had destroyed her trust in him and since then the relationship had rapidly
                                declined. I asked if she could ever forgive and what criteria he would need to fulfil to
                                do so. She felt that she was prepared to forgive him and work on the marriage only under
                                the condition that she sees change in GK. She said she needed to see the following
                                changes:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>To be faithful in the relationship.</li>
                                <li>To manage his pornography use.</li>
                                <li>To work on his own life and career.</li>
                                <li>To be more attentive to her. </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>These seemed like reasonable goals to expect out of her relationship at this point. Of
                                course these would be more GK undertaking than her own, but it was important that we
                                created an environment that motivated GK to make these changes. We then concluded the
                                session.</p>

                            <p>After the first session with clients I will have them complete a goal orientation tool as
                                well as my life wheel tool. GK had already completed this, but BK had not as it was our
                                first session together. I also taught her the Wim Hof breathing process and advised her
                                to do it twice per day to help with the anxiety.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="case-session" id="case8-session2">
                            <p>Upon seeing BK again we first went through her life wheel results. The life wheel is a
                                tool that shows you where you are with regards to different aspects of your life (giving
                                them a score out of ten for where you are now in life and then another score for where
                                you want to be in the future). BK gave the following scores:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Career: 8/10 to get to a 9/10</li>
                                <li>Friends and family: 7/10 to get to a 9/10</li>
                                <li>Relationship: 3/10 to get to an 7/10</li>
                                <li>Recreation: 5/10 to get to an 8/10</li>
                                <li>Health: 7/10 to get to a 9/10</li>
                                <li>Money: 7/10 to get to a 8/10</li>
                                <li>Physical environment: 9/10 happy with this </li>
                                <li>Personal growth: 6/10 to get to an 9/10</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>For brevity sake I will just quickly run through these points. In terms of her career,
                                health and money she was on the right track and was happy with her progress thus far,
                                she was very successful in all these fields and was bringing in the majority of the
                                money in the relationship. In these areas she just wanted to further progress naturally
                                as one does. She was happy in their home and the country they were living in. She was
                                also happy with her relationship with her parents, (more with her mum than with her dad
                                though). She saw the only real problems as being her relationship with her husband and
                                the fun in her life, since she found it difficult to be relaxed and have fun given her
                                current relationship issues. She also wanted to work on personal growth and self-esteem,
                                as both had taken a significant knock since the affair.</p>

                            <p>The set goal orientation tool involves taking a piece of paper and splitting it into
                                three sections. On the middle of the page the client writes down their current life
                                situation, this being; how they are doing in different areas in their life (career,
                                relationship. personal feelings and so forth); how do they feel in general and what is
                                precious to them in their lives. </p>

                            <p>On the left-hand side the client writes out their version of hell. This includes what
                                would be the worst way to feel? What do they personally consider to be the worst job
                                they could be doing? What would be the worst thing they could lose and so forth. The
                                idea should be to create a life that they would want to avoid from occurring but could
                                occur if they lost control of their life. </p>

                            <p>On the right-hand side the client writes out what they want their future to look like
                                (1-10 years from now). This should be done as a list of small and long term goals
                                (varying from a few hours in duration to taking months and years to complete). In
                                addition some elements of the future section involve the client identifying: what they
                                want their career to look like, how their relationship should be and what kind of
                                traits/ behaviours do they want to display. </p>

                            <p>We went into this tool in some depth during our session. Again for brevity sake I will
                                just just discuss what she put on the tool related to her marriage. Currently she was
                                largely happy with her life except for her relationship, personal growth and recreation.
                                In terms of hell it would be to waste her life in a loveless marriage, for her to lose
                                her job. Also to lose her parents and to lose her three kids (two boys and a girl).
                                Losing GK was also a fear of hers, although it was a lesser fear and something she had
                                prepared herself for over the years. In terms of what she wanted in her life, she wanted
                                to be in a marriage where she felt respected and understood. However if she couldn’t
                                have this she would focus on getting out of the marriage and being single. They had
                                three children (19, 15 and 7) so caring for their wellbeing was also of paramount
                                importance. She also wanted her life to feel more meaningful and enjoyable, perhaps to
                                rediscover a hobby or to try something new. This was a good start in motivating BK into
                                thinking about the kind of life she wanted and how we were going to make it happen.</p>

                            <p>At the end of the session I suggested BK watch a talk by Dr. Gottman relationship
                                missteps lecture. I advised her to take notes and to pick up on the missteps they were
                                making in the relationship. </p>

                            <p>In addition I set GK my relationship goal orientation tool to do. This is a tool which
                                has you break down different elements of your relationship. This being what you believe
                                you do well in the relationship and what are some of your downfalls, as well as listing
                                your partner’s strengths and weaknesses within the relationship among other things. I
                                also had GK complete these two tasks as well with the intention of comparing them to
                                BK’s in our next session. </p>

                            <p>Finally I had BK work on a plan how she would leave the marriage if she needed to. This
                                was to include who she would stay with, how would she go about the divorce proceedings
                                and what actions she would take to move on with her new life. The reason for this being
                                two fold. Firstly for peace of mind so she knows what she would do if she did choose to
                                leave the marriage. Secondly the plan would empower her to support her decisions and
                                boundaries. This would be the case as she would feel confident about her alternative
                                option of leaving. I suggested she did not show GK this plan but kept it for herself.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="case-session" id="case8-session3">
                            <p>At this point I had both GK and BK come to the session together and we went through the
                                relationship tool and the Gottman video. The aim of the session is for both parties to
                                give each other the opportunity to express what they both like and dislike within the
                                relationship. We aren’t necessarily looking for a solution yet, but are instead just
                                working on communication and behaviour identification in one another. </p>

                            <p>For brevity sake I won’t go into too much detail of the full discussion. To give an
                                example however from the Gottman video BK identified that she often criticized GK with a
                                nagging tone, which had pushed him away from feeling comfortable around her. As a result
                                she had started to feel like his mother and less like his wife. GK pointed out he often
                                ‘stonewalls’ BK when they have arguments due to an inability to manage the criticism.
                                The term stonewalling being to ignore a person usually by saying nothing, walking away
                                or dismissing their partners comments flippantly. This is usually done as a method to
                                avoid conflict but instead often makes the other person feel disrespected. I made it
                                clear that they would need to think about our relationship as the two of them versus the
                                problem, not each of them having their own problems to overcome. We then worked on
                                creating goals that attempted to satisfy both of their desires in a fair compromise.</p>

                            <p>At this point it was important that BK and GK attempt to rekindle their friendship.
                                Friendship within a relationship is vital and within BK and GK’s relationship it had
                                been virtually destroyed. To repair this friendship, they both needed to approach the
                                relationship from a different angle. Given that GK had a secreted sex life he would
                                continue to feel distant from his wife unless this was recognised and happily managed
                                together. In this regard GK would have to adjust his views towards his sex life with BK
                                and together they would need to work on being more open with one another, despite GK
                                discomfort. </p>

                            <p>For BK she would have to forgive and trust GK again if their relationship was going to
                                improve. Whilst she had reason not to trust, harbouring this lingering resentment and
                                anguish was preventing either of them from being happy in the marriage. Her past with GK
                                had carried a mental barrier that prevented her from forgiving him. With this in mind I
                                wanted to work on BK negative memories of GK using the BWRT process. I asked her to
                                write down a list of her most anxious memories and negative memories with GK with the
                                intention of doing BWRT in our next session. </p>

                            <p>I also set both BK and GK a guide to building healthy boundaries as well as the Dr.
                                Gottman ‘Seven principles to a working marriage’ reading material and tasks to complete.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="case-session" id="case8-session4">
                            <p>I then returned to working with BK and GK  separately for a couple of sessions. As mentioned the reasons being we would need to use BWRT to change BK mental templates of GK. This was a necessity as these past memories influenced her subconscious into not forgiving GK out of fear of being hurt again. However these same blockers were going to prevent her from her being happy and comfortable again, thus they negatively influence the relationship. To do this we would need to go through BK worst memories of GK and remove the negative emotions she had associated when thinking of GK. To do this I had her write down a list of her most anxious memories and her worst memories associated with GK. As mentioned I had her compose this list between sessions.</p>

                            <p>At this point we moved on to the BWRT process using level one techniques. For brevity sake I won’t re-explain it here If you would like to read more about BWRT please see case example one and case three. Do not attempt to perform BWRT upon yourself. </p>
                            
                            <p>Her most negative memory and one that stood out most prominently was BK finding GK’s phone will messages to a prostitute that he had been frequenting. The messages were very explicit and were heartbreaking. BK could remember this moment very clearly, as well as GK poorly trying to deny and downplay the situation. After this BK stated she had no trust in BK and afterwards had felt extremely angry upon recalling this memory, but also sadness.</p>
                            
                            <p>This seemed to be BK’s worst memory associated with GK, so it was the memory we worked upon. This memory we wish to change is titled the frozen memory. We then create the memory we will be overlaying on top of this negative frozen memory (known as the preferred response). Given that the frozen memory caused her a feeling of betrayal, sadness, hopelessness and loss, I wanted her to use a preferred response that was a memory that filled her with happiness and hope. We used the memory of completing a marathon she had run. This memory made her particularly happy and she could recall it with ease. </p>
                            
                            <p>I then had her create what is known as the future memory. This being a mental construct where the client pictures themselves in the future having overcome the problem. In the future memory we have the client imagine themselves doing a very simple action and reflecting upon their personal changes. This should be an activity that they do most days. In this case BK imagined herself doing yoga (which she did most days) and pictured herself having overcome her hurdles and now being in a happy marriage. </p>
                            
                            <p>We then went through the BWRT procedure which involves having the client move through the mental constructs within their mind. This is done many times quickly in a certain order for approximately ten minutes in duration. After we completed the BWRT loops I put here in a relaxed state then tested the emotional response of the frozen memory. This time she said it caused her no emotional distress to recall and was stunned by the result. </p>
                            
                            <p>I was satisfied with the result so at this point we concluded the session. For homework I had BK reflect upon the frozen memory and then to score how she felt out of ten, where zero was no sensation at all and ten was highly uncomfortable (it was a 1-2/10 when we tested it at that moment). I also set her some psychology teaching videos to watch and my ABC worksheet to personal behaviour identification (a worksheet set to help you point out and correct any behaviours you would like to change about yourself). </p>

                            <p>At this point we had worked together for some time and would continue to do so for further sessions. So I will briefly summarise the next few sessions we had after my fourth session with BK</p>

                            <p>In our fifth session we reviewed the boundary guide together, to which both of them have identified where they had overstepped the boundary and where they had been wrong on certain issues. In addition we reviewed the Gottman ‘Seven principles to a working marriage’ document and how parts of it applied to themselves and each other. This discussion was in no way critical of BK or GK but just an honest reflection on themselves. </p>
                            
                            <p>We spent the following sessions after moving between working separately and then working together, giving both clients a private session when needed and then a couple sessions for communication purposes when also needed. At this point in counselling their relationship now needed time for them to create new good memories together so I began to see them less frequently.and allowing them some time to work on their relationship. </p>
                            
                            <p>I continued to work with BK by herself on her self-esteem. Here I roughly conducted the same methodology as I used in case three. This included using level two BWRT (mentally becoming a superhero image of the self). I also conducted level two work with GK separately. The reasoning being that both GK and BK had issues with their self-esteem. In addition, it would be necessary for BK and GK to respect each other in the marriage. It was also important they respected themselves. In BK’s instance by working on her respect for herself we had given her the option to leave the relationship if she so wanted to and feel confident in doing so, thus empowering her decision making ability within the relationship with GK. </p>
                            
                            <p>We continue to work together sporadically for refresher sessions (once every 3-6 months) and from what I understand they are still together and considerably happier in their relationship. In particular I felt this was an interesting case given to the unusual nature of GK fetishes and how they influenced the relationship dynamic. </p>
                            
                            <p>Whilst all relationships are different and every therapy session is bespoked to the client’s needs, this case represents the approximate methodology I use to work with relationship issues.
