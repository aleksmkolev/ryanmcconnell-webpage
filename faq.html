                                <p>I offer mental health services that use a combination of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, Brain Wave Recursion Therapy (BWRT), breathwork, diet and exercise to improve the client's mental health.

                            <div class="faq-answer">
                                <p>I have a MSc in Psychology from the University of Liverpool, I also have a diploma in cognitive behavioural therapy and four accreditation in BWRT therapy. In addition I have a diploma in neuroscience. I also have accreditations in diet and exercise, however I now operate on partnership with Mind Body and Goals Doha for the purposes of physical training and guided dieting. If you would like more details about this partnership with MBG, my qualifications or any other questions send an email to <a href="mailto:ryanmcounselling@gmail.com">ryanmcounselling@gmail.com</a></p>

                            <h3 class="faq-question">What is therapy like with you?</h3>
                            <div class="faq-answer">
                                <p>My first goal is to create rapport with the client. If there isn't sufficient trust between myself and the client progress will be slow. When I feel the client trust me sufficiently we look at what issues they want to work on. We break the issues down and outline exactly why they are problems. We then create a solution both together (observing the pros and cons) and then enact upon it.</p>
                                <p>It is paramount that an environment is created where the client is learning, comfortable and feels they can speak without judgement. I also try to be as genuine as possible and encourage my clients to be likewise.</p>
                            </div>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-item">
                            <h3 class="faq-question">How many sessions will we have?</h3>
                            <div class="faq-answer">
                                <p>The amount of sessions undertaken varies depending on the subject matter and the issues addressed. For phobia it is only necessary to conduct two sessions and sometimes just a single session is required. For more chronic conditions or for change in mindset a usual amount is between three and eight sessions. The amount of sessions is completely up to the client and at the end of the first session I will outline a treatment plan as well as how many sessions I believe the client will need.</p>
                            </div>
                        </div>

                            <h3 class="faq-question">I feel nervous about having a session with a counsellor. Is that normal?</h3>
                            <div class="faq-answer">
                                <p>The therapeutic alliance between counsellor and client requires a trusting relationship to have success. At no point will I make you do anything you don't want to do. The vast majority of the time together spent will be pleasant and any difficult subject matters will be handled professional and kindly.</p>
                                <p>In the event it is necessary to broach a subject matter that is sensitive I will do so with care and only with your permission. If at any point you would like to stop and conclude the session you are welcome to do so.

                            <div class="faq-answer">
                                <p>Yes I do. I have previously done talks for Rumaillah Group, Al Ahamdia Medical Center and The Business Network (Doha branch). Currently I'm more focused on personal practice and teaching than given presentations, however if you would like me to present a bespoke topic for business purposes please get in contact <a href="mailto:ryanmcounselling@gmail.com">ryanmcounselling@gmail.com</a></p>

                            <h3 class="faq-question">How do you know we have been successful?</h3>
                            <div class="faq-answer">
                                <p>After the first session I will have a rough understanding of how long each issue will take to address and we will try and tackle them one at a time in the most sensible order. We will also outline a series of well defined goals. When we have achieved these goals to your satisfaction we are done. In the event we try a methodology that doesn't work we will try different methodologies until we find something that works for the client. Everyone responds to counselling differently and whatever aspects of the therapy the client responds better to is the predominant approach we will take.</p>

                            <h3 class="faq-question">Will it be a lot of hard work?</h3>
                            <div class="faq-answer">
                                <p>That's a difficult question to answer. Ultimately I will be looking to get you in a frame of mind that it doesn't feel like work but rather a necessity which needs to be conducted for the client to be a better version of themselves. I set work after each session but it is all completely optional.</p>
                                <p>In most cases clients find getting the courage to come seek help the hardest part of the experience and the work we do to be a very satisfying part of the experience.

                                <p>Yes, I offer a 10-15 minute zoom consultation completely for free. Email me and I will send you some times when I am available.</p>
                                <p>If for some reason the client misses the agreed time or does not show up, I can offer another time for a consultation, but this is at a one off charge of 200 riyals which needs to be sent beforehand, otherwise as you might imagine I could have a lot of my time wasted.</p>
