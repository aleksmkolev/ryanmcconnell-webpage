                    <p class="lead">Looking for a psychologist in Qatar? Hi there, my name is Ryan McConnell. I offer one-to-one mental health counselling for individuals based upon several state-of-the-art therapy techniques. This includes CBT (Cognitive Behavioural Therapy), ego development therapy and the recently developed therapy BWRT which focuses on dealing with subconscious issues and trauma. Clients have the option of choosing either online or in person therapy in Doha.</p>

                    <p>Whilst I am happy to provide clients with any single therapy methodology they so choose, my practice typically involves applying multiple therapeutic techniques simultaneously. These techniques work in tandem to boost the effectiveness of one another. By achieving small gains with each of these methodologies simultaneously, clients will see a significant overall boost in mental health rather quickly. As a result clients often experience significant mental health improvement within just a few sessions of therapy.</p>
                    
                    <div class="divider-line"></div>
                    
                    <p>Part of my process is focused on restoring harmony between the mind and the body. A healthy body will produce all the necessary chemicals to keep you in a contented state. This healthy state will give you the willpower to improve your day-to-day situation and persevere with struggles without feeling overwhelmed. The two are indisputably linked by a symbiotic relationship and therefore has some focus in my therapy process. In addition I place great emphasis on working with ego development and personal growth. Throughout the therapy I will have clients spend a portion of their time working on each of these factors.</p>

                    <p>All of the therapeutic approaches used are scientifically accredited and supported by peer-reviewed evidence.</p>

                        <h3>Breathwork</h3>
                        <p>The lungs are responsible for oxygen density and flow within the bloodstream. As a muscle itself the brain requires continuous oxygen. Control over one's breathing improves: alertness, energy levels, strength, cognitive function and happiness as well as providing a multitude of other health benefits. My therapeutic process involves the training of the lungs using simple but powerful techniques.</p>

                        <h3>Brain Working Recursive Therapy (BWRT)</h3>
                        <p>This therapy involves altering the subconscious mind. It takes a negative memory (of any given emotion) and overlays a preferred response (usually a calm and happy memory) with a special technique. After the process is concluded the negative emotion associated with initial memory gets removed, leaving the client feeling apathetic towards the memory.</p>

                        <h3>Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT)</h3>
                        <p>Cognitive Behavioural Therapy is the most commonly used therapeutic process today. It is a predominantly conversation based therapy that explores the relationship between a person's thoughts, their emotions and their displayed behavior, whilst setting realistic goals. By addressing these issues we can create a better life for the client and motivate them to make changes.</p>

                        <h3>Diet</h3>
                        <p>The symbiotic relationship between the body and the mind is undoubtedly real. The quality of our nutrition influences the quality of our bodies and thus all of our moods and our general behavior. If the client so chooses a portion of my therapeutic process involves placing the client on a customised diet that is mood boosting, obtainable and effective.</p>

                        <h3>Physical Fitness</h3>
                        <p>In order to achieve a healthy mental state it is important to keep ones body in the best possible condition. When your body is in great working function it is producing more feel good chemicals that boost your happiness throughout the day. During the therapeutic process we can if the client so chooses focus on improving your physical fitness to your personally desired level.</p>

                    <p>The therapeutic process firstly involves a free phone or zoom consultation. Contact me with the details of your concerns and we will outline a suitable plan together on how to tackle said issues. Providing the consultation goes well and we have some rapport we will then arrange an appointment time.</p>
                    
                    <div class="divider-line"></div>
                    
                    <p>Our first session usually involves allowing the client to present a comprehensive breakdown of their issues and giving them the full opportunity to vent all their frustrations. After this each of the issues are then categorised by importance and in the following sessions these issues are tackled systematically until they are all resolved/effectively managed.</p>
                    
                    <div class="divider-line"></div>
                    
                    <p>At the end of each session I provide the client with homework on what to work on until the next session. The main goal of my approach is to have the client become their own basic therapist in a manner of speaking, with the willpower and confidence to resolve issues by themselves. By the end of the therapy process the client will not need me, now having control over their issues and the ability to overcome them.</p>
